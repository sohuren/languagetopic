Once upon a time, there was a little frog in a little castle.<s>
The little frog was having a little party with all his little froggy friends.<s>
"I want to make them a cake!"<s>
he said, and so he went into the kitchen.<s>
In the kitchen, there were all the ingredients the frog needed to make the cake.<s>
There were eggs, milk, flour, sugar, and yes, frosting.<s>
The frog put all the ingredients in a bowl and started mixing them up.<s>
"I'm going to make the best cake ever!"<s>
he said.<s>
He took the cake and poured it into a blue bowl and popped it into the oven.<s>
He waited, and then, when it was done, he took it out.<s>
It was nice and golden brown.<s>
He put pink frosting all over the cake.<s>
It looked great!<s>
All the people at the party loved the little frog's cake.<s>
