Ted's Birthday  Ted was feeling happy as he looked into his bedroom mirror.<s>
He knew that tomorrow would be his birthday.<s>
Ted would be seven years old and his daddy was going to take him somewhere special.<s>
Ted's little brother Paul was playing with his alphabet blocks on the floor.<s>
Ted walked over and pat him on the shoulder.<s>
"Daddy said he's taking me to the new yogurt store," he told Paul.<s>
Paul is four years old so he asked Ted what a yogurt store was.<s>
"Yogurt is like ice cream," he told Paul, "and I'm going to get cherry."<s>
Paul said that he wanted cherry, too.<s>
Then Ted walked over to the closet.<s>
He looked at his favorite shirt and pants to wear tomorrow.<s>
Then he looked at his shiny black pair of shoes.<s>
He smiled because he would have a nice shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes to wear for his birthday.<s>
The two boys then heard the front door open and close.<s>
They raced down the stairs to greet their father.<s>
"Daddy, I'm ready for my birthday," Ted said.<s>
"Me too," said Paul.<s>
Their father laughed as he picked them up and carried them upstairs.<s>
