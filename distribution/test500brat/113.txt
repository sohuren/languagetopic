Sally wants to learn how to cook.<s>
She has only made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before.<s>
Today she is going to try to make some spaghetti with meat sauce.<s>
First she goes to the store down the street to buy the food.<s>
She buys six tomatoes, some beef, seasoning, one box of pasta and ten pieces of fruit.<s>
When she gets home she goes to the kitchen and starts boiling some water.<s>
The water takes four hundred seconds to boil.<s>
Next, she cuts up the beef and puts it in a pan to fry it.<s>
When the beef is cooked she starts to cut the tomatoes.<s>
When she is finished with the tomatoes she puts them in the pan and puts a lid on top.<s>
Once the tomatoes get hot she adds the seasoning and mixes the sauce.<s>
Finally she adds the cooked pasta to the sauce.<s>
Sally thinks that her spaghetti with meat sauce smells really good!<s>
She takes some to the table and starts eating her dinner.<s>
Her table is in the dining room.<s>
