It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy Bob.<s>
He was riding around on his horse.<s>
It was a good animal, and its name was Steve.<s>
Steve was an old friend to Bob.<s>
He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode.<s>
Bob's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm.<s>
It was a good job for cowboy Bob.<s>
He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time.<s>
He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view.<s>
As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared.<s>
Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day.<s>
Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm.<s>
Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote.<s>
Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.<s>
