On the farm there was a little piggy named Andy.<s>
Andy was very sweet, but he was always dirty.<s>
He loved to roll around in the mud.<s>
None of the other piggies wanted to play with him.<s>
He wished they would be his friends.<s>
One day he was going on a walk on the farm.<s>
He walked by and saw his favorite big tree.<s>
He walked farther than he ever had before.<s>
He saw a bunch of pretty flowers.<s>
Then he saw something that he had never seen before.<s>
It was a river!<s>
He ran down to the river, shouting with joy.<s>
He got down low in the cool water swam around for a bit.<s>
He ran back to the farm where the other piggies were.<s>
He was finally clean.<s>
They all played games until dinner time.<s>
When it was time for dessert the piggies each got a cupcake.<s>
Looking at all his new friends, Andy smiled and took a big bite of his tasty treat.<s>
