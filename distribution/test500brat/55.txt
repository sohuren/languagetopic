There were many people at the store that day.<s>
This was because it was Saturday.<s>
It was even more full of people around noon when Mary and her mother went out to go shopping.<s>
In the store, Mary wanted her mother to buy her candy but Mary's mother was in a hurry.<s>
She did not have time for that.<s>
That is because she wanted to get home before it started to rain.<s>
Mary crossed her arms when her mother said no.<s>
Mary was sad that her mother would not get her any candy.<s>
But at home, her mother had a surprise for her.<s>
She told Mary to close her eyes.<s>
She thought it might be a toy.<s>
When she opened them again, she saw that her mother had baked her something.<s>
Her mother opened the oven.<s>
Inside was a cake.<s>
She jumped up in excitement.<s>
She didn't need to think how she felt.<s>
She was very happy.<s>
She did not want the candy now.<s>
She immediately took a big slice.<s>
She wasn't sure it she would eat it now.<s>
Then she ate it before she could make up her mind!<s>
Her smile then left her mouth.<s>
She quickly she became sad.<s>
Her mother had told her it was bedtime.<s>
