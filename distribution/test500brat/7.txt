There was once a group of kittens who all liked to play together.<s>
Their names were Fluffy, Snowball, Cookie Monster, and Larry.<s>
Fluffy was the leader of the group, and whatever he said, the others did.<s>
One day he said, "Hey, everybody, let's go chase some mice."<s>
Everyone said "Yes!"<s>
except Larry.<s>
Larry did not want to chase mice.<s>
Larry wanted to drink some milk.<s>
He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said "too bad."<s>
So everyone went off to chase mice.<s>
The next day Fluffy said, "Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs."<s>
Everyone said "Yes" except Larry.<s>
Larry thought it was a bad idea.<s>
He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, "Too bad."<s>
So everyone went off to annoy the dogs.<s>
Except Larry.<s>
When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry.<s>
They started growling.<s>
They caught the kittens in their paws.<s>
The kittens yelled, "Help us!"<s>
Larry heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs.<s>
The dogs could not see Larry, only his shadow, which looked very big.<s>
The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered.<s>
"Yay Larry!<s>
We'll do anything you want!"<s>
