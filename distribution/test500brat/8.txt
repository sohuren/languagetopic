The sound of the women washing laundry down at the lake woke Lizzie up.<s>
She yawned, stretching out like a lazy cat.<s>
Her sister was also awake.<s>
"Lizzie", Meghan whispered, "are you awake?"<s>
Lizzie nodded and rolled out of bed.<s>
Meghan rolled over and went back to sleep.<s>
As Lizzie walked down the hallway, she accidentally stepped on Ralph's tail.<s>
"Woof!"<s>
Ralph yelled, in pain.<s>
"Sorry, Ralph", said Lizzie.<s>
Lizzie went down the stairs and into the kitchen.<s>
She ate some milk and cereal for breakfast.<s>
Then she sat down to write a letter to her dad.<s>
As she was writing she heard Ralph playing with his ball.<s>
Lizzie's dad was a driver for a rich family in England.<s>
She had only met her dad in person once, but they wrote letters to each other every week.<s>
Her dad was a very busy man, and he did what he had to for his family.<s>
Sometimes Lizzie wished she could go to England, too.<s>
It wasn't fair that the other girls got to see their dads every day.<s>
After writing a page, Lizzie stopped.<s>
Her hand was covered in the black ink of the pen.<s>
She washed her hands and dried them.<s>
Then she went outside to wait for the postman.<s>
She would mail her letter right away.<s>
