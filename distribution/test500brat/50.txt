It was almost Kira's birthday and Halloween.<s>
Kira wanted to paint pumpkins at the circus, but she was sick in bed.<s>
She had broken her leg earlier and now all of her leg hurt, even her toes.<s>
She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital.<s>
Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television.<s>
Just as Kira was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door.<s>
"Kira," she said.<s>
"Your friends are here."<s>
Kira looked up to see her two best friends, Lexie and Jamie.<s>
They were grinning.<s>
"Kira," Lexie said, "We got you something."<s>
When they entered, Kira saw that they had a giant pumpkin with them.<s>
Jamie was carrying a set of paints and paintbrushes.<s>
"Aww," Kira said.<s>
"Thank you, guys."<s>
"Duh," Lexie said.<s>
"What are friends for?"<s>
