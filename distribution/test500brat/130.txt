A cowboy named Steve wanted to take a vacation from his farm that was named Raindrop.<s>
He could not make up his mind where to go, so he saddled his horse and rode east.<s>
The sun was setting in the west and it was orange.<s>
A cold wind was blowing from north to south.<s>
Steve rode through a forest of pear trees next to his farm.<s>
The first place he came to was a small town full of quiet people and its name was Silence.<s>
No one would talk to Steve.<s>
He kept riding.<s>
The town was next to a forest of maple trees.<s>
The second town he came to was very cold and its name was Ice.<s>
Steve was afraid his horse would freeze if he stayed there.<s>
Everyone in the town was wearing large coats and mittens.<s>
The second town was next to a forest of pine trees.<s>
The third town he came to was warm and it was named Sunny.<s>
There were palm trees on the beach.<s>
Steve and his horse went to the beach and played in the ocean.<s>
Steve took off his boots.<s>
Steve's hat got wet in the water.<s>
He had to leave it on the beach to dry.<s>
Eventually Steve and his horse got hot.<s>
They rode east again.<s>
Eventually Steve arrived back at his farm.<s>
This confused him because he thought he had been riding in a different direction.<s>
Steve learned that there really was no place like home.<s>
He put his horse in the barn and went back into his house.<s>
