Randan's parents surprised her one day by bring home a small bunny.<s>
This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it.<s>
After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play.<s>
That was when everything went wrong.<s>
After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away.<s>
Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off.<s>
Later that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed.<s>
All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside.<s>
They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it.<s>
Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away.<s>
She said to herself that it could not have done it.<s>
The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan.<s>
Nothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night.<s>
This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was.<s>
When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep.<s>
Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house.<s>
They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry.<s>
The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger.<s>
The dad got some glue and made the bunny's butt stuck on the carpet.<s>
Randan grabbed the bunny by the leg and threw it to space.<s>
