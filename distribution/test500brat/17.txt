Joe and his friends wanted to join the school's Christmas show.<s>
He asked his friends at school what would be a good idea for the Christmas show.<s>
They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use.<s>
One person wanted to do a dance show.<s>
Another person wanted to put on a play.<s>
So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper.<s>
Then he took everyone's idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea.<s>
He read the idea out loud to his friends.<s>
It said, "musical".<s>
So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical.<s>
The first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job.<s>
Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show.<s>
Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights.<s>
Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes.<s>
Later, Joe wanted more singers so he added Sam and Marsha as singers.<s>
On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended.<s>
Joe and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream.<s>
The ice cream shop was all out of Joe's favorite flavor, strawberry, so Joe chose to get chocolate ice cream instead.<s>
