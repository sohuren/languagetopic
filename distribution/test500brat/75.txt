Michelle and Anthony were having lunch in the park with their mother.<s>
She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips.<s>
As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch.<s>
There was one family that had 3 dogs with them.<s>
The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people.<s>
Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy.<s>
Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips.<s>
Michelle said no, that she was full.<s>
They got up and went over to the family with the dogs.<s>
The white dog jumped on Michelle and licked her face, knocking her down.<s>
The brown dog wagged his tail and sniffed Anthony.<s>
The black dog was shy and went to sit with his family.<s>
After they said goodbye to the dogs, Michelle and Anthony saw their friends Mike and Molly across the park.<s>
They asked their mom if they could go play with them and she said yes.<s>
They ran to their friends and told them about the dogs they had met.<s>
Mike and Molly's mom gave Michelle and Anthony some strawberry ice cream for dessert.<s>
They thanked her, and when they finished, they went back to their mom, ready to go home and take a nap.<s>
