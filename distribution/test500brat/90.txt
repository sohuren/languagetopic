There once was a dog named Bruno.<s>
Bruno belonged to a family, the Smiths, but he was most loved by Sarah.<s>
Sarah was the youngest child in the house, she lived there with her mom, dad and older brother Fred.<s>
Bruno would sleep with Sarah every night, and wake up with her every morning.<s>
Together they would eat cheese and ham for breakfast every day!<s>
One day after breakfast Sarah was getting ready to go to school, but something scared her!<s>
There was a big storm.<s>
Sarah was too scared to go to school with all of the thunder and lighting.<s>
Bruno could tell Sarah was scared, and did the only thing a dog could do, Bruno walked with Sarah to school the whole way so she was no longer scared!<s>
