Little Tony was riding his bicycle all around the party.<s>
After all grandma gave him it right now.<s>
What fun would it be for Tony if he couldn't show off his new bike?<s>
He rode it up and down the hills and through the people at the party.<s>
It was his party.<s>
Everyone knew that it was his party.<s>
He was turning 8, 8 candles on the cake and the number 8 frosted on, the number 8 on his birthday hat.<s>
The big 8.<s>
It was much better than his last birthday.<s>
He didn't like being 7.<s>
He loved riding his bike closer and closer to people and things.<s>
Until he ran right into the big table with his birthday cake.<s>
All 8 candles flew all over the ground of the lawn.<s>
Tony was upset, and so was daddy at the big huge mess he made.<s>
He could have been more careful daddy said, and looked where he was going.<s>
He was right, Tony was being too crazy.<s>
But it was his party, so he kept riding, with more care this time.<s>
He rode his bike up and down.<s>
Faster and faster.<s>
Until Tony's birthday finally was over, long after it began.<s>
