My cat's name is Buggleton.<s>
She is black and white with big green eyes and very long whiskers, like a bug.<s>
When I woke up this morning, my cat was not inside the house.<s>
She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases.<s>
She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures.<s>
We can lock the cat door so she can't go outside when we go on vacation.<s>
If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her.<s>
So it was very weird to wake up and see that she was not home for her morning food!<s>
My husband and neighbor and I called for her, but she did not come.<s>
Guess where she was?<s>
Trapped in the garage overnight!<s>
