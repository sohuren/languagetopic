Andy was a small boy who, like many small boys, loved to play.<s>
He would play outside.<s>
He would play in his basement.<s>
He would play in his room.<s>
When he played, he would play with lots of things.<s>
Sometimes he played with blocks.<s>
Sometimes he played with cards.<s>
Sometimes he would even play with his sister's dolls.<s>
One day, Andy became bored.<s>
"Maybe I'll play outside," said Andy.<s>
He tried to play outside, but it didn't seem right.<s>
"I know," said Andy, "maybe I'll play in the basement."<s>
So he tried to play in his basement, but that didn't seem right either.<s>
"I guess I can play in my room," said Andy.<s>
So he went to his room to play, but he still felt bored.<s>
"Maybe I need to play with something different," said Andy.<s>
So he tried to play with his blocks, but he was still bored.<s>
"I'll play with my cards," said Andy, but they weren't fun either.<s>
"I'll play with my sister's dolls," said Andy, but he kept being bored.<s>
Andy was starting to get sad, and then his sister Angie came in and asked, "Do you want to play, Andy?"<s>
"Yes," said Andy.<s>
And they played with blocks, and dolls, and cards.<s>
And they had fun.<s>
As it turns out, all Andy needed was somebody to play with.<s>
