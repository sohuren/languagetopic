On Mother's Day Sunday I went to breakfast with my mom, sister and wife.<s>
The day before that, I bought my mom a lovely bunch of flowers.<s>
My mom had eggs, my sister had pancakes, and my wife had toast.<s>
I had a muffin.<s>
The restaurant was called Maggie's.<s>
It was not my favorite breakfast restaurant.<s>
I like Denny's or a diner.<s>
Breakfast was not good.<s>
The pancakes were soggy, the toast was burned and the eggs were cold.<s>
Even worse, my breakfast made me sick.<s>
But after breakfast we went back to my house and I gave my mom the present I bought.<s>
It was a sunny day, and we all had a nice afternoon.<s>
