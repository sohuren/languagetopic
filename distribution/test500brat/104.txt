A lamb named Lana woke up on an early Monday morning.<s>
After taking a shower and getting dressed, she chose to start making something to eat.<s>
In the end, she made eggs, toast and coffee for her breakfast.<s>
While she was eating, she was called on the telephone by her good friend Drake the dog.<s>
They chose to meet up after Lana finished eating so they could take a walk around the park.<s>
Drake also told her that their friend, Terry the turtle, would not be joining them.<s>
As soon as Lana finished cleaning her dishes, she heard a knock on her door - it was Drake!<s>
She threw on her coat and went outside, so they could start their walk.<s>
In the end, they spent a few hours walking along the park's sidewalk, until ending up back near Lana's house.<s>
"Let's do this again soon!"<s>
Drake said, as he wagged his tail.<s>
"Sure!"<s>
Lana said, as she walked back into her home.<s>
Lana made a light dinner, cleaned up, then chose to hop into bed.<s>
She soon fell asleep.<s>
