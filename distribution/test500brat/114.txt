A boy named Pedro was walking down the street one day, and he met a pretty girl in a pink dress who handed him a bell.<s>
It was made of metal, and looked worn and old.<s>
The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else.<s>
Ring the bell three times to get your wish.<s>
Not two, not four, but three.<s>
When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else.<s>
Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy.<s>
Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner.<s>
It was black with brown and white spots.<s>
He picked the puppy up and hugged it.<s>
Then he saw his friend Alice.<s>
He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird.<s>
Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder.<s>
Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away.<s>
The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.<s>
