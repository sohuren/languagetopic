Today Bob was hungry.<s>
He had some pancakes in his fridge but did not feel like eating pancakes today.<s>
He thought to himself, "I want to get some food from the store."<s>
So he went to the store and bought a sandwich.<s>
When he was at the store there was a picture of a brown cat on the wall.<s>
Under that picture was a box full of candy.<s>
Bob knew that he did not want to eat too much candy, but he wanted to get some candy anyway.<s>
He went to the box of candy and put some in his shopping bag so he could buy it.<s>
Bob went to the front and paid for all of his food.<s>
After buying his food, he went home and ate it.<s>
The sandwich was delicious and after he ate the sandwich he ate the candy too.<s>
Bob was very happy that he was full now and no longer hungry.<s>
