Bob and Sue were in class.<s>
Bob was listening to the teacher.<s>
Sue was looking out the window, thinking about what she would do during recess.<s>
The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.<s>
She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.<s>
Then they could read more books.<s>
The teacher thought reading was always a very fun activity.<s>
While thinking, Sue planned how she would climb the tall tree in the playground.<s>
It had many low, thick branches.<s>
She wanted to see what the yard looked like from up above.<s>
She did not think reading was a very fun activity at all.<s>
She would rather be outside.<s>
Bob took lots of notes on what the teacher was saying.<s>
He also copied down everything she wrote.<s>
He was very proud of his notes.<s>
If the other students ever needed help, he was glad give it to them.<s>
He thought reading the books people his age told him to read boring.<s>
However, he loved borrowing books from his older sister.<s>
Those books were exciting to him.<s>
He wanted to learn more vocabulary so he could better understand the stories in his older sister's books.<s>
Soon enough, the bell rang.<s>
Sue practically ran out the door on her way to the tree.<s>
Bob stayed behind to thank the teacher before he left.<s>
