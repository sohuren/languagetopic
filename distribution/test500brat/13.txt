Jack and his uncle went out walking in the woods near the river.<s>
They saw many things when they were in the woods.<s>
They saw a chipmunk, a butterfly, a squirrel and some birds.<s>
Jack heard a wolf howl.<s>
All of the sudden Jack heard a train whistle.<s>
It scared all of the animals away and that made Jack sad.<s>
After a bit, Jack heard his Auntie calling for them.<s>
Jack hoped that it was time for lunch because he was getting very hungry.<s>
He hope that there would be cookies to eat, he didn't want for there to be any vegetables.<s>
When they got to the house, his auntie was waiting there with a cake for them.<s>
Jack was excited and finished the sandwiches that she had made them for lunch.<s>
When they were finished his uncle told him that it was time to go home.<s>
It was getting late and Jack was going to be late for his bedtime if they didn't hurry.<s>
His bedtime was going to be a little earlier tonight because he had to go visit the doctor tomorrow and so there would be no story time before bed.<s>
Jack told his uncle that he had a great day and hoped that they could do it again soon.<s>
