The dinosaur wants to have a pet goldfish.<s>
He is reading a book called, "How to Take Care of Your Pet Goldfish" because he wants to learn how to take care of a goldfish.<s>
After he finishes reading the book, he goes to the pet store.<s>
The pet store is not in Detroit, St. Louis, or Pakistan.<s>
The pet store is in a town called Oceanside.<s>
It takes the dinosaur an hour to walk to the store.<s>
The store is very big, so that the dinosaur can fit inside.<s>
A worker from the store walks up to the dinosaur and asks, "How can I help you?"<s>
"I'm looking to buy a pet goldfish," the dinosaur said.<s>
"Are you sure?"<s>
the worker asked, "We have rainbow fish, red fish, and blue fish.<s>
The rainbow fish makes for a great pet."<s>
"No, thank you," the dinosaur said, "Goldfish are my favorite."<s>
And so the worker put a goldfish in a bag of water for the dinosaur.<s>
"Why did you put the goldfish in a bag of water?"<s>
the dinosaur asked.<s>
"Fish always love to have something to swim in," the worker answered, "Enjoy your goldfish!"<s>
And so the dinosaur walked home, his new best buddy in hand.<s>
