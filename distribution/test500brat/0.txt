It was Sally's birthday.<s>
She was very excited.<s>
She was going to have a sleepover at her house for her birthday.<s>
She invited all of her best friends.<s>
The party was at 1 on Saturday.<s>
Jessica, Erin, and Cathy all arrived at 1, but Jennifer was late.<s>
She did not come until 2, because she could not find her other shoe.<s>
The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool.<s>
They had so much fun.<s>
They played with the foam noodles in the pool.<s>
Erin accidentally kicked Jennifer's leg in the pool.<s>
After they swam, everyone rinsed off and went inside.<s>
They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV.<s>
After it got dark, they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories.<s>
Sally tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon after.<s>
Cathy got scared when they were telling stories, and wanted to call her mom to go home.<s>
The other girls told her that it is only a story.<s>
She felt better.<s>
They all fell asleep at 11.<s>
Sally was the first to wake up at 8 in the morning.<s>
She made pancakes for her and her friends.<s>
They all loved the pancakes, except Erin.<s>
She ate some fruit instead.<s>
At 10, all the girls went back home.<s>
Sally was happy that she had such a great birthday party.<s>
