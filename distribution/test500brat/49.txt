Bill and Steve went to the park.<s>
It was a nice Saturday afternoon.<s>
They both rode their bicycles to the park.<s>
Bill and Steve were hoping to use the swings, but when they showed up, the swings were being used by Anne and Susan.<s>
"Can we use the swings?"<s>
Bill asked the two girls, hoping they were almost done.<s>
"Not now," said Anne.<s>
"We have only been here for a little bit."<s>
Bill was disappointed, but there were so many other things to do at the park.<s>
Bill and Steve went to the slide.<s>
Up and down they went, faster and faster, every time!<s>
It became a race, Bill and Steve ran back to the ladder as quickly as they could so they could go down again.<s>
After a half hour, the two boys were very tired from climbing the ladder and flying down the slide so quickly over and over.<s>
They went to their bikes to go back home.<s>
As they started going home, they saw Anne and Susan had left.<s>
They could use the swings before going home!<s>
