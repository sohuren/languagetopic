There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole.<s>
His name was Isaac.<s>
He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting.<s>
He didn't like making cake much.<s>
In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys.<s>
But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves.<s>
One day, he got a smart idea.<s>
He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out.<s>
So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on.<s>
He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes.<s>
He really looked like an elf!<s>
So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory.<s>
Luckily, it worked, and no one found out!<s>
Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before.<s>
It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas.<s>
He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog.<s>
That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac.<s>
He didn't look like the rest of the elves.<s>
So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was.<s>
One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off.<s>
When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf!<s>
He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in.<s>
Isaac begged Joe not to tell.<s>
Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting.<s>
Joe never told.<s>
