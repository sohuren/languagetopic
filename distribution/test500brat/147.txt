All of Larry's friends have a favorite animal.<s>
Jim's favorite animal is the bear.<s>
Tracy's favorite animal is the monkey.<s>
Ryan's favorite animal is the rabbit.<s>
But Larry's favorite animal is the panda.<s>
The only problem is that Larry has never seen a panda.<s>
In fact, none of Larry's friends have seen one.<s>
One time, Larry and his friends went to the zoo.<s>
There were many animals at the zoo, and everyone was very excited to them.<s>
There were monkeys, bears, and even rabbits.<s>
When they went to see the monkeys, Tracy even handed one of the monkeys a banana and the monkey ate it.<s>
But there was no panda.<s>
Everyone started to think there was no such thing as a panda.<s>
If Larry was going to see a panda, he would have find one himself.<s>
He packed up his backpack with sandwiches, a chocolate bar, and some water and he went out into the forest.<s>
He knew that a panda's favorite food was leaves, so made sure to pack some leaves in his backpack too.<s>
He spent two week in the forest looking everywhere for a panda.<s>
Finally, when has about to give up, he saw a family of pandas eating and playing.<s>
He gave them all the leaves in his backpack.<s>
He sat watching them for the rest of the day.<s>
He watched pandas bathe and climb trees.<s>
Then he went home and went to sleep.<s>
