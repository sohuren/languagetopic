Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta.<s>
Asta lived in the ocean.<s>
There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived.<s>
They played all day long.<s>
One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends.<s>
They looked up and saw the bottle.<s>
"What is it?"<s>
said Asta's friend Sharkie.<s>
"It looks like a bird's belly," said Asta.<s>
But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly.<s>
It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it.<s>
The bottle floated above them.<s>
They wanted to open it.<s>
They wanted to see what was inside.<s>
So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean.<s>
They cracked it open on a rock.<s>
When they got it open, they found what was inside.<s>
It was a note.<s>
The note was written in orange crayon on white paper.<s>
Asta could not read the note.<s>
Sharkie could not read the note.<s>
They took the note to Asta's papa.<s>
"What does it say?"<s>
they asked.<s>
Asta's papa read the note.<s>
He told Asta and Sharkie, "This note is from a little girl.<s>
She wants to be your friend.<s>
If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her.<s>
But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her."<s>
And that is what they did.<s>
