A cat was watching a bird in a tree.<s>
The blue bird watched the cat as it tried to use its claws and climb up the tree.<s>
The cat reached the right branch and slowly walked towards the bird.<s>
The bird flew away and the cat was left stuck on the branch.<s>
The cat jumped down from the tall branch and didn't get hurt.<s>
He then chased after a chipmunk along the ground.<s>
The chipmunk was not faster than the cat, but the chipmunk ran up a tree.<s>
The cat tried to run up the tree, but fell back down.<s>
Not wanting to go back up a tree, the cat watched the chipmunk from the ground.<s>
