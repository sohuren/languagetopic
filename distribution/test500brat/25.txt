A naughty boy was sitting in math class on Tuesday.<s>
There was a broken sink in the back of the room full of water.<s>
There was also a kitty on the open window.<s>
A loud plane was flying outside and scared the kitty inside.<s>
The naughty boy walked up to the kitty and picked it up.<s>
What do you think he did next?<s>
He threw the kitty into the water in the sink!<s>
The kitty didn't last long and ran away from the sink faster than lightning!<s>
The other children laughed and laughed, but the teacher didn't think it was funny.<s>
She didn't let the naughty boy play on the playground for a week!<s>
But the boy didn't care.<s>
The class thought he was funny, and so did he.<s>
But he would have to get smarter because the sink was fixed soon.<s>
The naughty boy thought the teacher was a witch who used a magic kiss to fix it.<s>
He had no idea that her husband fixed it the next day.<s>
