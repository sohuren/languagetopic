There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet.<s>
One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play.<s>
He picked up her favorite toy frog.<s>
When he did, he hit his elbow on the table.<s>
Ouch!<s>
He rubbed his elbow and frowned.<s>
Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.<s>
Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard.<s>
He walked outside.<s>
Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun.<s>
They made him feel sleepy.<s>
He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck.<s>
He pushed two chairs together to make a bed.<s>
He climbed up and lay down.<s>
He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow.<s>
He lay his head on it.<s>
Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.<s>
While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by.<s>
It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap.<s>
A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too.<s>
The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.<s>
Jacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping.<s>
"What a peaceful group," she thought.<s>
And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"<s>
