It was finally summer vacation, and Josh was excited to go to his favorite place.<s>
He was heading to Florida, to visit his Grandma and Grandpa.<s>
Josh spends every summer there, and this summer would be no different!<s>
In the mornings, Josh and Grandma would plant cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots in the ground.<s>
After they would be planted, they would water and weed the garden every day.<s>
In the afternoons, Grandpa would take Josh out on the ocean in his sailboat which was named "Sea girl."<s>
Josh loved "Sea girl" and his favorite part was smelling the salty ocean air.<s>
Sometimes Josh and Grandpa would go to a beach and make sandcastles, or start digging until they found buried sea shells or other treasures.<s>
At night, Grandma and Grandpa would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool.<s>
On special nights, Josh got to get ice cream for dessert.<s>
A lot of times, Grandma made dinner dishes that included the vegetables Josh and Grandma were growing.<s>
It was his favorite time of year.<s>
Josh couldn't wait to leave tomorrow morning!<s>
