Billy and his friend Jake were walking together to meet their friends Kevin and Gordon at the park.<s>
They sometimes played in each Jake's backyard, but there was much more room at the park.<s>
And it was far too dangerous to play in the street.<s>
They were going to play touch football.<s>
They would sometimes played baseball and soccer, and even kickball but today the weather was perfect for football.<s>
The summer breeze almost blew Billy's cap off.<s>
Billy loved summertime.<s>
He liked the fall, too, when the leaves started to turn pretty colors.<s>
But he hated winter.<s>
