Annie's sister, Julia, was having a birthday party in the afternoon.<s>
Annie's mother was going to bake the cake for the party.<s>
Mother asked Annie to help her bake the cake.<s>
They chose to make a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.<s>
Annie got the bowls and the ingredients they would need for the cake.<s>
She helped measure the flour, the sugar and the cocoa.<s>
Once her mother added the rest of the ingredients, Annie was allowed to stir the ingredients in the bowl.<s>
She helped to pour the cake mix into two pans and then put them in the oven.<s>
The smell of the cake made Annie hungry.<s>
While the cake was baking, Annie helped her mother make the chocolate frosting.<s>
Her mother let her lick the spoon when they were done mixing the frosting.<s>
Once the cake was done, Annie and her mother took the cake out of the oven and let it cool, and then they frosted it.<s>
They ate the chocolate cake at Julia's party with scoops of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries.<s>
Annie gave their dog, Sunny, a little piece of cake too!<s>
