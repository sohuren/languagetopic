The red fox slowly walked out of his den he lives in; his own house in the ground.<s>
His eyes bounced side to side as he made sure the coast was clear, then he ran down the path of autumn leaves.<s>
As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch.<s>
He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on.<s>
He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple.<s>
He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor.<s>
The fox slipped and he fell off the branch, but landed safely in a pile of leaves near the apple.<s>
He picked up the apple in his mouth and quickly brought it back to his warm den.<s>
When he arrived back home, his two fox kits were waiting for him with hungry tummies.<s>
Spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it was always warm in the fox den.<s>
