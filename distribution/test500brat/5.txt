Derek was sad.<s>
He was playing in the school yard at recess and a girl in his class was being mean to him.<s>
Her name was Sandy.<s>
Sandy was best friends with Alexis.<s>
Alexis was nice to Derek, but Sandy kept being mean.<s>
Sandy kicked dirt at Derek and called him mean names.<s>
Alexis felt bad that her friend was so nasty to Derek.<s>
Derek knew that Sandy did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown.<s>
All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to Derek and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy.<s>
He told Derek he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot.<s>
Derek remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man.<s>
Sandy and Alexis were on the jungle gym and they saw Derek running from the stranger.<s>
They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom.<s>
Sandy and Alexis came into the classroom screaming for help.<s>
