A man named Albert had the choice to build a tree house, a garage, a desk, or a cabinet.<s>
Albert chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.<s>
Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.<s>
Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.<s>
Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.<s>
Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot.<s>
The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.<s>
It would make him very happy.<s>
Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.<s>
Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.<s>
He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.<s>
He got started and it was very hard.<s>
One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.<s>
Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.<s>
His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.<s>
They both looked at it, and Albert's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.<s>
Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.<s>
He had done it all by himself, and he was happy to see his son being so happy as well.<s>
They would have a long summer of playing together in the tree house that Albert built.<s>
It was one of the best tree houses ever!<s>
