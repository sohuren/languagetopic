A young mother had a child that was in kindergarten.<s>
One day, the class took a trip to the zoo.<s>
This was the start of a very good day.<s>
The child had a lot of fun.<s>
The animals were very friendly, and the friendliest of all was a baby tiger, which the child called 'kitty'.<s>
The mother laughed when her child asked to see a unicorn.<s>
Instead, she gave her daughter a cookie and they had some ham sandwiches for lunch.<s>
They had lunch by the stone benches in the park area.<s>
There was a trashcan nearby.<s>
The mother threw their trash in the trashcan when they were done.<s>
Then they went to go see the pigs.<s>
The pigs made a noise like 'oink'.<s>
There were also cows.<s>
There was also a slide.<s>
The slide was a water slide, and the child begged her mother to let her go down it.<s>
At the end of the day, the child was dirty and tired, but she had a lot of fun.<s>
