One day Kyle's Dad had to go for a long ride.<s>
He went on this ride because he wanted to get breakfast.<s>
With breakfast the dad always loved to get a banana in a drink.<s>
This was his favorite drink.<s>
But along the ride, Kyle's dad had a scare.<s>
The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book.<s>
Later he found his book in a white bin.<s>
Along with the book, there was a white costume.<s>
He thought that maybe this was a sign.<s>
So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume.<s>
He remembered that his son Kyle's favorite thing to do was play doctor.<s>
This made him remember that he never even asked his son Kyle if he wanted to come for the ride.<s>
So the dad turned around and drove all the way home to get his son.<s>
He asked Kyle if he wanted to come out to breakfast.<s>
Kyle got very excited and said he did.<s>
Kyle's dad was happy he came back because it helped him make his son happy.<s>
