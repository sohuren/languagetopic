The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning.<s>
Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here!<s>
It's here Janet, it's here!"<s>
That voice belonged to my sister, Karen.<s>
What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point.<s>
She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas.<s>
We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year.<s>
I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.<s>
Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew.<s>
As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake.<s>
They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach.<s>
The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun!<s>
We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in.<s>
Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn't let her.<s>
Overall, we had a lot of fun and look forward to the next go around.<s>
