One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee.<s>
He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened.<s>
He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor.<s>
His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her.<s>
The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor.<s>
The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day.<s>
The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever.<s>
After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked Sam about his knee.<s>
Sam told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down.<s>
Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like Sam more about their accidents.<s>
The doctor said, "Wow Sam!<s>
It sounds like you had quite a fall."<s>
The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home.<s>
On the way out of the doctor's office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home.<s>
Sam's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside.<s>
Sam's mom really cared about him and didn't like to see him get hurt.<s>
