There was once a young bear who lived in a small cave in the woods.<s>
His cave was comfy, warm, and dark, and had a bit of a yard in front of it.<s>
The bear lived with his mother and father, and spent his days walking around and his nights curled up asleep.<s>
He liked to look for berries to eat.<s>
His favorite berries were blueberries, but he would eat any berries he found: strawberries, raspberries, cherries, anything.<s>
There was a river near the bear's cave, and he loved to sit on the bank and look at the fish and frogs, and at his own reflection in the water.<s>
One sunny afternoon, when he was looking into the river, he saw a family of ducks swimming by.<s>
He got up and followed them.<s>
They swam along in the river, and he walked along the bank.<s>
They traveled like this until they reached a small clearing in the forest.<s>
The bear stopped and looked around, and saw that the clearing was completely filled with blueberries -- more than he had ever seen!<s>
The young bear ate his fill of blueberries, then took home as many as he could carry in his paws.<s>
He went to bed happy.<s>
It was a wonderful day.<s>
