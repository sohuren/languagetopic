There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods.<s>
This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods.<s>
Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him.<s>
One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries.<s>
It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit.<s>
When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest.<s>
It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade.<s>
The mouse then sat back.<s>
After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep.<s>
Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse.<s>
The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips.<s>
Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.<s>
"What are you doing?!"<s>
asked the mouse in surprise.<s>
"I am trying to find dinner," said the cat.<s>
The mouse smiled.<s>
"I collected extra berries today on my walk.<s>
Would you like to have some?"<s>
The cat was confused.<s>
He had never been given such a kind thing.<s>
"Well, OK.<s>
Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."<s>
The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries.<s>
It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.<s>
