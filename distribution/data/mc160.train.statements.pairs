I didn&#39;t trust that guy because he looked very strange.  After we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted to talk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I saw that the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him to leave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time he was dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside the house and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the cop car coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day.</t>

      <t>One sunny day, Martha went on a walk through the park. While walking, she noticed something strange. No one was outside. She was the only person at the park. &quot;How strange, where is everyone?&quot; she thought. Martha looked everywhere. She looked inside the restrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually, she would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one of her friends popped up, surprising her.

      <t>In a far away land known as Board, there was a great man named Pawn. This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess. Pawn did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn&#39;t like some of the other people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal battle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as Queen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn woke up and knew that it was only a dream.

But the stool wasn&#39;t tall enough on its own.  He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen sink he could reach the oranges.  (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator). So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of the sink to get the oranges.

He sat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.  Then he took all of the pieces of orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.</t>

The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats.

      <t>I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn&#39;t even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn&#39;t sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!</t>

We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn&#39;t even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn&#39;t sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!</t>

When the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the hats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in town would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and play and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids&#39; favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the family would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished they would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for bed.

On one street there was a red house, a green house, a blue house and one purple house with yellow stripes. The people in the town were all very friendly and knew each other well.  When the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the hats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in town would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and play and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids&#39; favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the family would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished they would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for bed. They would put their pajamas on but never wear socks and they would get under the covers and fall asleep.</t>

Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.

Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, &quot;Lauren, get in here now!&quot;  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren&#39;s mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate&#39;s eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate&#39;s eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle&#39;s eyes were all better. Chocolate&#39;s shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma&#39;s earrings.

      <t>School is out for the summer.  Jake and Jimmy are playing on a baseball team. They are both nine years old this year.  Their team is called the Knights.  Jake plays first base and Jimmy is a pitcher.  They both love baseball.  They started playing when they were four years old.  It is so fun for them.  Their team has won three games so far.  They beat the Jets, the Bluejays, and the Hawks so far.  They have not lost any games yet.  They are playing the Tigers today.  The Tigers have not lost any games either.  The score was one to one until the last inning.  There were two outs.  Jimmy came to the plate.  The pitcher named Johnny threw the ball hard.  Jimmy swung his bat too late and missed.  He missed the next pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard to center field.  The Tiger player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over his head and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The Knights won the game!</t>

She didn&#39;t like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary&#39;s mother didn&#39;t understand why Mary didn&#39;t like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary&#39;s mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn&#39;t think so all the time. Mary&#39;s friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary&#39;s father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary&#39;s father took Mary&#39;s sewing things and gave them to the poor children. &quot;No more sewing, Mary!&quot; He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn&#39;t sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn&#39;t come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary&#39;s friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary&#39;s father saw Mary go to one of her friend&#39;s house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.</t>

      <t>Cindy and Mary were playing at recess. They were having a great time until Cindy brought up Allison&#39;s birthday party. Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not. This hurt Mary&#39;s feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She couldn&#39;t believe that she had not been invited to Allison&#39;s birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?  After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn&#39;t invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn&#39;t understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison&#39;s party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.

      <t>Cindy and Mary were playing at recess. They were having a great time until Cindy brought up Allison&#39;s birthday party. Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not. This hurt Mary&#39;s feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She couldn&#39;t believe that she had not been invited to Allison&#39;s birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?  After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn&#39;t invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn&#39;t understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison&#39;s party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.</t>

She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.  She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because she is older.  He didn&#39;t care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her.   Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn&#39;t want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.  Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, &quot;close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!&quot;  It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her &amp; Eduardo!

She wondered if he would really love her always,  because she is older.  He didn&#39;t care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her.   Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn&#39;t want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.  Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, &quot;close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!&quot;  It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her &amp; Eduardo!  It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.  Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, &quot;Thank you everyone,  for helping us!&quot;</t>

      <t>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, &quot;Remember to wear your helmet,&quot; and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, &quot;Helmets are for girls!  You&#39;re not cool if you wear a helmet!&quot;  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, &quot;What are you, scared?&quot;  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren&#39;t working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn&#39;t have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it&#39;s important to not care what other people think, and those that think you&#39;re not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren&#39;t cool in the first place.</t>

Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, &quot;What are you, scared?&quot;  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren&#39;t working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn&#39;t have to say it.

The store had all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish. Mitch ran for the turkey section of the store with much force. &quot;Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I want to eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!&quot; Mitch would cry out to strangers he met in the turkey section of the store. Then, four and a half seconds later, Mitch turned into a giant Walrus named Ted! No one knew how this could have happened, but the Walrus knew. A few years later, Mitch the now giant Walrus named Ted joined the circus and became a rich man with green in his heart. He could not think of anything else but making more money at his circus. One day Ted the giant Walrus, also known as Mitch the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast. Now that Ted was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast.

One day Ted the giant Walrus, also known as Mitch the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast. Now that Ted was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast. Ted the walrus also remembered that he had earlier built a time machine. Ted the giant walrus used his time machine to go back in time to buy his mother who was now a dog named Herbert. Ted&#39;s mother, Herbert loved the big turkey, but there was a small problem. Herbert the dog didn&#39;t have any teeth!</t>
      <h>Dino the dog faced boy was Ted the Walrus before he was a giant walrus.</h>

They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk!  He would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.  Tommy has an old bicycle now. He is getting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him!  But what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.

      <t>Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named Winston, Chester, and Francis. Chester was a brown rabbit with large eyes. Francis was grey and white and had messy fur. Winston was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of flower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel&#39;s name was Acorn. Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms.

      <t>Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn&#39;t know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn&#39;t seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn&#39;t remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked her sister. &quot;I miss you. I am so lonely,&quot; answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  &quot;She died in her sleep.&quot; &quot;It is best that way.&quot;</t>

      <t>Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn&#39;t know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn&#39;t seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn&#39;t remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked her sister. &quot;I miss you. I am so lonely,&quot; answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  &quot;She died in her sleep.&quot; &quot;It is best that way.&quot;</t>

      <t>A little boy named Joey did not like to brush his teeth. One day, as his mother asked him to brush his teeth, Joey said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to! It&#39;s gross and a waste of time!&quot; In response, Joey&#39;s mom told him that in order for him to grow up and be big and strong like she is, he must brush his teeth. In disgust, with his mom watching to make sure he brushed his teeth right, he brushed his teeth and whined until he was finished. The next day, Joey did not brush his teeth and told his mom that he did. After going to school, one of Joey&#39;s friends said that his breath stunk and began to make fun of him. This made Joey very angry, so he pushed the boy over and started to cry. A teacher came over and called the principal as both kids were being loud and starting a fight. Joey&#39;s mom came to school and took him home. After asking what was wrong, Joey told his mom that he didn&#39;t brush his teeth. After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth. &quot;You won&#39;t get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!&quot; she yelled, and then left the room. From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn&#39;t make fun of him.</t>

She said, &quot;Bailey, we could make some money.&quot;  &quot;How?,&quot; asked Bailey.  &quot;Well, it is hot outside,&quot; said Kara. &quot;People are thirsty out there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay for it.&quot;  &quot;That is a great idea,&quot; answered Bailey, &quot;let&#39;s do it!&quot; Kara had made some iced tea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said yes.  She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made a sign so people knew what was for sale.  Kara&#39;s mom helped them get a table and chairs and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw their stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their friends, Abby and Molly.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all out of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money.

      <t>Bailey and her friend Kara were bored one Saturday.  It was a hot summer day.  They didn&#39;t want to stay inside any longer but they didn&#39;t know what to do.  They were tired of watching TV inside.  Suddenly, Kara had an idea.  She said, &quot;Bailey, we could make some money.&quot;  &quot;How?,&quot; asked Bailey.  &quot;Well, it is hot outside,&quot; said Kara. &quot;People are thirsty out there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay for it.&quot;  &quot;That is a great idea,&quot; answered Bailey, &quot;let&#39;s do it!&quot; Kara had made some iced tea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said yes.  She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made a sign so people knew what was for sale.  Kara&#39;s mom helped them get a table and chairs and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw their stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their friends, Abby and Molly.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all out of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and each got ten dollars.  It was a great day.</t>

Chris felt bad for Bob and reached into his pockets to help his friend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper. Chris&#39;s eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without Jim and Jeff seeing, Chris quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paper airplane at Jim. The plane hit Jim in the face.

She had seen the yarn that was kept in a basket up there!  &quot;That looks like it&#39;s fun to play with!&quot; said Fuzzy. &quot;But how could we get to it? It&#39;s so high up,&quot; he wondered.  &quot;I have an idea,&quot; said Snowball. &quot;Watch this!&quot; Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch.  &quot;What are  you doing?&quot; asked Fuzzy.  &quot;Just watch!&quot; said Snowball. Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then, she jumped to the middle shelf.  &quot;That&#39;s dangerous!&quot; said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens. They weren&#39;t used to jumping very high yet.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be careful. I think we&#39;re allowed to be up here.&quot; said Snowball. Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. &quot;Look out below!&quot; she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor.  &quot;Whoa!&quot; said Fuzzy. &quot;Thanks!&quot; Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor. There, she and her brother played with the ball of yarn until they got tired and took a nap.</t>

      <t>The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. &quot;Hey, you look like you need some fun,&quot; he said.  &quot;Want to go fishing?&quot; I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn&#39;t have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.</t>

      <t>The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. &quot;Hey, you look like you need some fun,&quot; he said.  &quot;Want to go fishing?&quot; I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn&#39;t have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.</t>

Bob loved potatoes. He collected around 600 potatoes! Bob started to run out of room for all the potatoes he found. He then started to eat as many as he could. In 1 hour he ate 100 potatoes! He got so full he took a nap. When he awoke he found the cat eating all the potatoes! The cat ate 200 potatoes before Bob awoke. However, Bob was too full and fat to move.

She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but other bully squirrels came, too. The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrel peanuts to eat. She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave the three-legged squirrel alone.  The winter snow melted and then it was spring. The grass turned green and the air was warm. Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-haired lady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide the peanuts for later. The squirrel would hold the peanut in its mouth and dig and dig and dig, and then it would put the peanut in the hole and pat it down with its little front paw. Then it would run back over to the brown-haired lady and get some more peanuts to eat.</t>

Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim&#39;s toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim&#39;s mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.

Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim&#39;s toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim&#39;s mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.  Tim&#39;s mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. Tim thought it was a very good day.</t>

Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn&#39;t find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle&#39;s house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.</t>

      <t>On Saturday, Amy and Joe baked a whole chicken for their family&#39;s dinner.  They rinsed it in cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.  After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.  Amy said, &quot;Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night. We&#39;ll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?&quot;  Joe said, &quot;We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice.&quot;  Amy said, &quot;How about chicken soup?&quot;  Cindy said, &quot;I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.

What can we do with the leftover chicken?&quot;  Joe said, &quot;We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice.&quot;  Amy said, &quot;How about chicken soup?&quot;  Cindy said, &quot;I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven&#39;t made those in a long time.&quot;   &quot;That sounds good,&quot; said Amy.  &quot;We&#39;ll make that for dinner tomorrow.&quot;  &quot;Yum!&quot; said Joe.  &quot;That&#39;s a great idea.  I love Thai noodles.&quot;  Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand how to do these math problems!&quot;  Joe said, &quot;You two go ahead.  I&#39;ll do the dishes and put away the leftovers.&quot;  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken. It was almost gone!  &quot;Dad!&quot; said Cindy, &quot;You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We can&#39;t have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow.&quot;  Joe looked very sad.  He said &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.  Would you like a piece of chicken?&quot;</t>

Eliza had difficulties doing both her schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math. Her best friend Maddy was also a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances. Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.  In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called &quot;The Beauty and the Rain&quot;. The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who left the performance center looked so tired. They couldn&#39;t pick up their practice bags off of the floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy. When Eliza got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems. All she could think of was bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.  Her teachers started to become aware of Eliza&#39;s problems in the classroom and called her parents into school to talk to her teachers.

      <t>John thought about things that he liked to do.  Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the sport. He didn&#39;t even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!  He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn&#39;t really like all of the passes). He wasn&#39;t quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn&#39;t play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.</t>

He wasn&#39;t quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn&#39;t play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.</t>
