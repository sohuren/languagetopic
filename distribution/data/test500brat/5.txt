It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.<s>
There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.<s>
He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.<s>
It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.<s>
Sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.<s>
A tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.<s>
He got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.<s>
He used the wires to fix the fence.<s>
Now, it was time to catch the crook.<s>
Sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.<s>
But they weren't a crook's footprints.<s>
It had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.<s>
