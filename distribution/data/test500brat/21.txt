Three cats named Daisy, Sofia, and Abby wanted to start a band.<s>
They put an ad in the newspaper because they needed a drummer.<s>
Daisy and Sofia would play guitar and sing.<s>
Bass would be played by Abby.<s>
A few weeks passed and no one called about the ad.<s>
Finally, one afternoon the telephone rang.<s>
A deep voice said, "Do you still need a drummer?"<s>
Daisy said, "Yes, come by this afternoon."<s>
Daisy got the other cats together and they set up their instruments and waited for the drummer to show up.<s>
Soon a dog came running up, pulling a set of drums behind him.<s>
"You're the drummer?"<s>
Sofia hissed.<s>
"Scram!"<s>
said Abby.<s>
But Daisy was more accepting.<s>
"C'mon guys, we need a drummer.<s>
Just let him play!"<s>
she said.<s>
"Okay," said Sofia and Abby.<s>
They started to jam.<s>
"We need to come up with a name," Sofia said, between songs.<s>
"How about 'Atomic Death Fish?'"<s>
said Abby.<s>
"No, too scary," said Sofia.<s>
"How about 'Monkeys on Mars?'"<s>
said Daisy.<s>
"Too goofy," said Sofia.<s>
"How about 'Sofia and the No Nos?'"<s>
said the drummer.<s>
"I love it!"<s>
everyone said.<s>
