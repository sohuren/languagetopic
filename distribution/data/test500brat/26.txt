Paul woke up to the sun shining in his eyes.<s>
He was so excited!<s>
Today was the big day for the baseball game and he was very excited!<s>
He rolled out of bed and jumped in the shower, whistling a happy song.<s>
Downstairs he could hear his baby brother, Mike, crying and he had to giggle to himself.<s>
He got out of the shower and pulled on his clothes.<s>
He looked at the calendar on his desk and smiled knowing yesterday, Friday, had been the last day of school.<s>
"Hi, Mom!<s>
No school Monday," he laughed.<s>
He gave his baby brother a kiss on the cheek and grabbed a piece of bacon.<s>
"Is that all you are eating, Paul?<s>
You need to have a good meal before you leave."<s>
said mom.<s>
"Yes, I am meeting John and Terry at the playground and I am late."<s>
He grabbed his glove and bat and ran outside, right into a mud puddle from last night's rain.<s>
He got to the playground and John was wiping his head.<s>
"Whew, it is very hot now!"<s>
"It is going to be a hot summer since it was so cold this winter.<s>
It is hard to believe last month there was snow on the ground."<s>
The boys jogged to the playing field and shook hands with the other boys.<s>
"This is going to be a great game, the first of the summer."<s>
one of the boys said.<s>
The game started and everyone had a turn.<s>
Paul's team was behind by two points.<s>
Terry took his place at the plate.<s>
"Batter up!"<s>
The pitcher threw the first ball.<s>
"STRIKE ONE!"<s>
Then the second and crack, the bat hit the ball and it flew through the air.<s>
Terry ran to the first base.<s>
Next, John hit the ball with the first throw and he ran to first base and Terry stole third base.<s>
The third player was Joey, a red headed boy.<s>
He was not a very good player and he missed the ball three times.<s>
"OUT."<s>
He was followed by George and he also made an out.<s>
Up came Tiny.<s>
He hit the ball and made it to first base, John moved to second and Terry stayed on third.<s>
CRACK!<s>
HOME RUN!<s>
Paul ran around the bases and Terry, John, and Tiny all made it in.<s>
Paul saved the game and the day!<s>
Paul's team won the first game of the summer!<s>
