One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast.<s>
I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup.<s>
First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup.<s>
Delicious!<s>
I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade.<s>
I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard.<s>
Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig.<s>
But today there were only a few flamingos.<s>
I opened up the book I was reading, "All About Birds."<s>
I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins.<s>
While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck.<s>
I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up!<s>
I had never seen one so close to my face.<s>
"Er, what's up?"<s>
I asked.<s>
"Not much," he said.<s>
"I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."<s>
"Sure, little guy," I said.<s>
I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out.<s>
While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm.<s>
He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door!<s>
And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.<s>
