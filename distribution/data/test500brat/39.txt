The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along.<s>
The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together.<s>
The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard.<s>
He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it.<s>
He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything.<s>
Not even water.<s>
Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye.<s>
He ran to it.<s>
He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle.<s>
The cat took a big drink.<s>
It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing, but the others were done and the bird had flown away.<s>
