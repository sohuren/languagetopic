There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo.<s>
He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others.<s>
He was quieter than the others too.<s>
He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him.<s>
Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.<s>
One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle."<s>
He started to feel tired.<s>
But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise.<s>
They were yelling and banging things together.<s>
The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.<s>
Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell.<s>
He hung it on a branch.<s>
Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo.<s>
He waited.<s>
He was very quiet and small.<s>
He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo.<s>
She was with her mother and father.<s>
Then he jumped into her red backpack.<s>
He was so small that she didn't know he was there.<s>
The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.<s>
When the girl got home, she set down her backpack.<s>
Her brother thought he saw her backpack moving.<s>
Her sister thought she heard something.<s>
But nobody knew that a tiny, sleepy monkey had come home from the zoo.<s>
He was happily sleeping in the girl's backpack in her quiet house, away from all the other noisy monkeys.<s>
