My mommy has a really cool job!<s>
She makes costumes for movie stars.<s>
She works in the attic of our house, so I get to see her work all the time.<s>
I watch every movie I can, and try to learn all of the different costumes by heart.<s>
Mommy says if I work hard and keep up my practice, one day I'll get to to make costumes for movie stars too!<s>
That job sounds like heaven.<s>
One day I was in the attic, helping Mommy make a boot for a costume.<s>
They were covered in little beads, and mom had to sew them on.<s>
She kept dropping the needles on the ground.<s>
Then I was helping by picking them up.<s>
I was also helping by moving the lamp around so Mommy could see the boot better.<s>
"Ouch!"<s>
I said.<s>
"I accidentally stuck my finger with the needle!"<s>
My mommy looked at my finger, and gave it a kiss.<s>
"Welcome to the life of a costumer!"<s>
