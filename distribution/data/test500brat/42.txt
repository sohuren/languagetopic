John wanted to have a birthday party for his son, Mike.<s>
John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane.<s>
So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party.<s>
When the clown arrived, ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show.<s>
His parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come.<s>
The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face.<s>
This caused John's face to turn red.<s>
After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party.<s>
There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground.<s>
Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat.<s>
The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles.<s>
Since it was Mike's birthday they let him choose.<s>
He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order.<s>
When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas.<s>
Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen.<s>
John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner.<s>
