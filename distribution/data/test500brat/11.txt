Pester came running into the room.<s>
He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog.<s>
He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before.<s>
It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring.<s>
That still confused him.<s>
He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small.<s>
And it was so hairy.<s>
It was a like a mop that could run around.<s>
He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it.<s>
She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself.<s>
He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it.<s>
He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention.<s>
After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.<s>
