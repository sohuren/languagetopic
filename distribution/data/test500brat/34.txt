Josie started planning her new garden in the winter.<s>
She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area.<s>
She looked through the seed magazines.<s>
She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower.<s>
She talked to a friend about her plans.<s>
It seemed like the snow would never melt.<s>
But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started.<s>
Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors.<s>
The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow.<s>
Finally spring arrived.<s>
Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures.<s>
Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil.<s>
She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better.<s>
When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden.<s>
The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow.<s>
