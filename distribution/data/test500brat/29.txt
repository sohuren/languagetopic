It was Tuesday.<s>
Tuesday was Square's favorite day.<s>
Wednesday was nice because it was always Spaghetti Night.<s>
Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons.<s>
But Tuesday?<s>
Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend Diamond.<s>
It was a beautiful day!<s>
The spring wind was blowing, and the sun was shining.<s>
Square and Diamond went to play by the river.<s>
They were having a great time.<s>
They swam.<s>
They fished.<s>
They played hide and seek.<s>
Suddenly, the wind picked up.<s>
"Hey, Square!<s>
Would you like to see a trick?"<s>
"Sure Diamond!<s>
What is it?"<s>
Diamond took a string out of its pocket.<s>
Diamond tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree.<s>
"Watch this!"<s>
Diamond jumped into the wind.<s>
Suddenly, she was flying!<s>
She floated.<s>
She swooped.<s>
She played with the clouds and the birds.<s>
She flew faster.<s>
She flew slower.<s>
At first, Square was amazed.<s>
But slowly, Square started to frown.<s>
Diamond landed in front of her friend.<s>
"What's wrong?"<s>
"That was amazing!<s>
It looks like a lot of fun.<s>
But I am not shaped like a kite.<s>
I can't do those amazing things like you."<s>
Diamond smiled.<s>
"Yes you can, Square!<s>
Stand on your tip-toes!"<s>
So Square did.<s>
"Now, go look at yourself in the river."<s>
Square walked to the river and looked down.<s>
But he did not see a square.<s>
He saw a diamond!<s>
Diamond handed Square the string.<s>
"Now jump!"<s>
she said.<s>
Square jumped.<s>
He jumped as high as he could.<s>
Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up.<s>
He was flying, like Diamond!<s>
He floated.<s>
He swooped.<s>
He played with the clouds and the birds.<s>
He flew faster.<s>
He flew slower.<s>
He soon landed.<s>
The sun was setting, so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday.<s>
It was a beautiful day.<s>
