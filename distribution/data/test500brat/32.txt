"I don't think I can win the race" Tim told his parents over breakfast.<s>
His mother asked "Why not?"<s>
but his father was silent.<s>
Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner.<s>
The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run.<s>
Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run.<s>
Tim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick!<s>
No one ever beats her at recess."<s>
"Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.<s>
Tim took an apple and walked to the bus.<s>
Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began.<s>
He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.<s>
3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin.<s>
All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants.<s>
Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied.<s>
As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began.<s>
By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.<s>
It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run.<s>
By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time.<s>
Tim's father asked, "What took you so long?<s>
I'm surprised to see you here at all!<s>
Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"<s>
Tim thought about why he signed up.<s>
It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud.<s>
It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.<s>
