Sammy loved playing baseball.<s>
He would play every day, even if there was no practice that day!<s>
One day, Sammy went to the park with his mom to play catch with his friends, but as he was playing, he tripped over a rock, and his shoe slipped off!<s>
His shoe went flying into the air, high up into the sky, and Sammy watched as the shoe fell into old man Mr. Grumpy's yard.<s>
What was he going to do?<s>
His mom sat on a bench not too far away, reading a book.<s>
"Should I tell Mom?"<s>
Sammy thought to himself.<s>
He thought that maybe he shouldn't, because he might get in trouble.<s>
Instead, he was going to climb the fence into Mr. Grumpy's yard!<s>
"What, are you crazy?"<s>
Sammy's friend Billy said when he told him what he was going to do.<s>
Billy didn't seem to like the idea.<s>
"Mr. Grumpy is a mean old man, and he'll yell at you for sure.<s>
I think you need to tell your mom!"<s>
With that, Billy ran off to tell Sammy's mom!<s>
Sammy ran after Billy, trying to get him to stop, but Billy told the whole story before Sammy could get there.<s>
After Sammy's mom heard the story, she took Sammy by the hand and said, "Come on, Sammy, let's go get your shoe!"<s>
Sammy was worried.<s>
What was she going to do?<s>
Sammy's mom took him straight to mean old Mr. Grumpy's door, and knocked on it.<s>
"Oh no!"<s>
thought Sammy, "He's going to yell at me!"<s>
But the man who opened the door was a nice old man, and he smiled at little Sammy, and let them get his shoe.<s>
That's when Sammy learned that it's always better to be honest.<s>
