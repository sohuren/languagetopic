Once upon a time there a little girl named Ana.<s>
Ana was a smart girl.<s>
Everyone in Ana's school knew and liked her very much.<s>
She had a big dream of becoming spelling bee winner.<s>
Ana studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling.<s>
Ana's best friend would help her study every day after school.<s>
By the time the spelling bee arrived Ana and her best friend were sure she would win.<s>
There were ten students in the spelling bee.<s>
This made Ana very nervous, but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew she could do it.<s>
The spelling bee had five rounds and Ana made it through them all.<s>
She was now in the finals.<s>
During the final round James, the boy she was in the finals with, was given a really hard word and he spelled it wrong.<s>
All Ana had to do was spell this last word and she would be the winner.<s>
Ana stepped to the microphone, thought really hard and spelled the word.<s>
She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct".<s>
Ana had won the spelling bee.<s>
Ana was so happy.<s>
She won a trophy.<s>
Ana also won a big yellow ribbon.<s>
The whole school was also happy, and everyone clapped for her.<s>
The whole school went outside.<s>
They had a picnic to celebrate Ana winning.<s>
