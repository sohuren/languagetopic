Once upon a time a young boy and young girl set out on a trip to the beach.<s>
They packed a few towels, an umbrella, a few beach chairs and a lunch cooler.<s>
They drove to the crowded beach parking lot and spent almost an hour trying to find a parking spot.<s>
Once they found a spot they parked and began walking to the beach area.<s>
They found a nice spot with a good view of the water and set up their belongings.<s>
Once they sat down they began to enjoy a nice lunch on the beach.<s>
They watched the boats go by and people playing in the water.<s>
It was a wonderful day and one they would always remember.<s>
Once they arrived home they suddenly found out that they both had a pretty good sunburn.<s>
They both said that next time they would use sun screen.<s>
