Sara wanted to play on a baseball team.<s>
She had never tried to swing a bat and hit a baseball before.<s>
Her Dad gave her a bat and together they went to the park to practice.<s>
Sara wondered if she could hit a ball.<s>
She wasn't sure if she would be any good.<s>
She really wanted to play on a team and wear a real uniform.<s>
She couldn't wait to get to the park and test out her bat.<s>
When Sara and her Dad reached the park, Sara grabbed the bat and stood a few steps away from her Dad.<s>
Sara waited as her Dad pitched the ball to her.<s>
Her heart was beating fast.<s>
She missed the first few pitches.<s>
She felt like quitting but kept trying.<s>
Soon she was hitting the ball very far.<s>
She was very happy and she couldn't wait to sign up for a real team.<s>
Her Dad was very proud of her for not giving up.<s>
