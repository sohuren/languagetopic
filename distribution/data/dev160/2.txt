Todd lived in a town outside the city .<s>
Unlike the city the town was peaceful and quiet and full of trees, flowers and animals.<s>
One day his dad came in from work and said "Come on, son, I'm going to take you to the city."<s>
Todd was very exited so he put on his shoes and ran to the car.<s>
When they got to the city Todd was very surprised there were so many cars and people, everyone seemed to be in a hurry.<s>
There were no trees, no flowers, and no animals.<s>
Todd was so happy to get back home.<s>
When his mom asked him about his trip to the city Todd said,"There's no place like home."<s>
