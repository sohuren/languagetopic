My parents, Kelly and Kelley, said that it was that time of year to take a family vacation.<s>
We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.<s>
This year my parents wanted to do something different.<s>
They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.<s>
After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.<s>
My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the long car ride there.<s>
Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.<s>
There was so much to see and so much to do.<s>
There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor.<s>
What a magical place!<s>
I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family!<s>
We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places.<s>
There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.<s>
My brother, Kelsey, and I played hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.<s>
It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories.<s>
We'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle!<s>
