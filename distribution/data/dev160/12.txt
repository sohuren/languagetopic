Three little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a great big cat to hide.<s>
Their great big cat was named Cowboy.<s>
And Cowboy was not a very nice cat.<s>
Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things.<s>
When Cowboy was happy, which was not very often, Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth.<s>
When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds.<s>
And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide.<s>
Cowboy would hide, curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by.<s>
When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them.<s>
He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice.<s>
Cowboy was only a cat.<s>
A great big cat that did not know any better.<s>
