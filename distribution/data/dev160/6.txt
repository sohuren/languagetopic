Roger was a grasshopper.<s>
He loved to hop.<s>
He hopped everywhere by himself.<s>
One day when he was hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log.<s>
The frog told him his name was Gilbert.<s>
Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into anybody.<s>
Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would make great friends.<s>
The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something very strange.<s>
In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad.<s>
The spider was very sad because he did not have any friends.<s>
Roger and Gilbert asked him why he didn't have any friends.<s>
The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him.<s>
Roger and Gilbert told him that he didn't look scary to them and that he could come along with them if he wanted.<s>
So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a life time friendship full of adventures.<s>
