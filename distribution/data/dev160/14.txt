This is a story about a bear and a wolf.<s>
The bear met the wolf one day in the woods.<s>
The bear said to the wolf, would you like to go to the river with me?<s>
The wolf said yes, he would like to go to the river.<s>
When the bear and the wolf got to the river they found that a beaver had built a bridge to the other side of the river.<s>
The bear and the wolf crossed the bridge that was built by the beaver and found that they were now in a part of the woods they had never seen before.<s>
A little worried that they may get lost in this part of the woods they had never seen before the bear and the wolf turned around.<s>
They went back over the bridge and were happy to be back in a part of the woods they knew so well.<s>
The beaver thanked both the bear and the wolf for trying out his new bridge and then started to build yet another bridge close to the first bridge.<s>
He was a very busy beaver.<s>
