Every Monday morning, the little bad boy named Josh goes to school.<s>
Suddenly, little Josh slips on a banana skin ...  - Ouch, says Josh, I fell on this and in addition I got a bump on the forehead!<s>
- Wonderful!<s>
said the banana peel.<s>
I am Mary.<s>
I turned into banana skin after throwing trash on the school yard.<s>
You have saved me and now I'm back to good old Mary.<s>
What's your name?<s>
- Mine is Josh... I'm a late to class ... are you serious, where is the banana peel anyways?<s>
- The Banana, my dear Josh, was eaten by me, I threw the banana peel and turned into one ... now you saved me, can you see the banana peel you slipped on around here?<s>
- No, you are right.<s>
- Mary said:  Josh, Thank you  - Excuse me, Mary ... I have to go ... Otherwise I'll be late for school ... And I would not want to upset the teacher.<s>
