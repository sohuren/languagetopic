Peter was a very sad puppy.<s>
He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time.<s>
In fact, he had been there for three months!<s>
Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one.<s>
He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough.<s>
He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies.<s>
However, one day all of this changed.<s>
Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy.<s>
She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with.<s>
It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day.<s>
Sammie came to hold him.<s>
Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired.<s>
He fell right to sleep.<s>
Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms.<s>
Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.<s>
