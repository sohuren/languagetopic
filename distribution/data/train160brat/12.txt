James is going to the baseball field with his friend Tommy.<s>
James has to practice because baseball season starts in a week.<s>
He wants to be a good player when the season starts.<s>
James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.<s>
He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.<s>
James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.<s>
So James and Tommy practice every day.<s>
They throw the ball around.<s>
They practice batting and they practice fielding.<s>
Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.<s>
He says "I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!"<s>
Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.<s>
Then James has a setback.<s>
His glove rips during practice.<s>
He can't keep playing with a broken glove!<s>
So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.<s>
James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.<s>
This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!<s>
So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.<s>
By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team.<s>
