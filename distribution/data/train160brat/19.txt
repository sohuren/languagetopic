I used to be afraid of butterflies!<s>
It is true!<s>
Once, my mom took me to Seattle.<s>
There, we went to a special place.<s>
We went to the zoo!<s>
I saw lots of animals at the zoo.<s>
I saw bears.<s>
I saw tigers.<s>
I saw apes.<s>
I saw monkeys.<s>
I saw snakes.<s>
I loved seeing all these animals.<s>
They made me happy.<s>
We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.<s>
In fact, I like bugs.<s>
But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.<s>
You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.<s>
My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.<s>
I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.<s>
My mom said I would be okay.<s>
My brother said I would be okay.<s>
They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.<s>
They said they would not hurt me.<s>
So I went in the room.<s>
Guess what?<s>
I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!<s>
The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.<s>
He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.<s>
I said I was sorry, but I was scared.<s>
He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!<s>
I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.<s>
Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.<s>
They would try and get me to not be afraid.<s>
Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.<s>
She bought one for my brother, too.<s>
I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.<s>
It became really fun to do.<s>
Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.<s>
I liked it.<s>
It tickled me.<s>
It did not hurt me.<s>
Now, I like butterflies!<s>
