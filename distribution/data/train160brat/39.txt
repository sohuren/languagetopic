Tommy's birthday is next week.<s>
He is hoping for a very special gift.<s>
What are some things Tommy is hoping for?<s>
He would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends Bobby and Joey have.<s>
One with blue stripes!<s>
He would really like some new sneakers.<s>
Danny, Tommy's best friend, got a special pair of sneakers for HIS birthday last month.<s>
They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk!<s>
He would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.<s>
Tommy has an old bicycle now.<s>
He is getting too big for it.<s>
He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.<s>
It looked like it was the right size for him!<s>
But what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.<s>
Today his Mom and Dad said that he might have one very, very soon.<s>
Then Tommy and his little brother can have many fun birthdays together.<s>
That would be the best gift of all!<s>
