The dog was playing in the street outside.<s>
I walked past the dog and threw the ball to him.<s>
He seemed to be hot from the heat of the day.<s>
I then headed to the store because I needed to buy some food and other things that were needed.<s>
I entered the store and said hi to Mr. Jones.<s>
He had been working at the store for a long time.<s>
I walked to the back of the store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice.<s>
I then went and picked up some popcorn.<s>
This would be good for eating later while watching tv.<s>
I then went to the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog.<s>
I then went up to the front of the store and paid Mr. Jones.<s>
He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store.<s>
Then I walked back to my house and looked at the dog.<s>
His name was Rex and had lived with us for around four years.<s>
His coat was brown and white.<s>
I unwrapped the dog treat and gave it to him.<s>
Rex seemed happy and started to lick my hand in happiness.<s>
He was a good dog and it made me feel good that he was happy.<s>
