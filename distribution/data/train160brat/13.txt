Flying a kite can be dangerous.<s>
When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dad to fly my new kite.<s>
We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind.<s>
It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air.<s>
As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite.<s>
I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground.<s>
The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller.<s>
I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake.<s>
Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water.<s>
I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat.<s>
I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up.<s>
He took me out for ice cream and we went home.<s>
