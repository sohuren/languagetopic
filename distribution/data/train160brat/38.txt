The walls were brown and dirty.<s>
The lights were yellow.<s>
Door A was blue.<s>
This was Beta's choice.<s>
Door B was red.<s>
Door C was the same color as door A. Door D a color no one had seen before.<s>
Gamma felt that Alpha needed to make a choice soon before the monsters caught their scent.<s>
Delta was the first to voice a choice.<s>
He wanted to go in the red door.<s>
Alpha told him that the old books said to go in the blue door.<s>
This is why it was so hard for Alpha right now.<s>
