A small yellow fish swims up to the glass and looks at Johnny.<s>
"A yellow fish!"<s>

Lots of blue fish swim by behind the yellow fish.<s>
"Look at all of those blue fish!"<s>

He still wants to find a green fish.<s>
He sees a lot of fish, but none of them are green.<s>
"Daddy, I can't find a green fish.<s>
I want to see a green fish."<s>
Daddy laughs.<s>
"Let's go to the next window and look."<s>
Johnny looks through the next window and sees lots of fish, but none of them are green fish.<s>
"I still don't see any green fish," says Johnny.<s>
