Mary was a little girl who loved to sew.<s>
She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts.<s>
She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long.<s>
One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night!<s>
Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to!<s>
Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time.<s>
Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew.<s>
She woke up and she began to sew.<s>
She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom.<s>
Mary's father was very worried about Mary.<s>
He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.<s>
One day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children.<s>
"No more sewing, Mary!"<s>
He said.<s>
He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried.<s>
Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more.<s>
Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would.<s>
When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up.<s>
Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses.<s>
Abby thought it was a great idea.<s>
So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again.<s>
When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy.<s>
Soon everyone was happy again.<s>
