Billy had a pet turtle that he took good care of, everyday.<s>
His turtle's name was Tumble.<s>
Tumble liked to walk around outside in the garden and dig small holes to sleep in.<s>
Billy loved Tumble and would visit him outside when he got home from school.<s>
Tumble's favorite food was oatmeal.<s>
So, every day after school, Billy would make Tumble a big bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for Tumble to enjoy.<s>
Tumble would see Billy and walk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.<s>
Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it.<s>
When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it.<s>
But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.<s>
Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat.<s>
Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.<s>
Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl of oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday.<s>
