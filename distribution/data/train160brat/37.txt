The other day Mitch went to the store to buy his mother a big turkey.<s>
Inside the store there was food all over!<s>
Mitch could not believe his own little eyes.<s>
From the first time Mitch woke up this morning he knew that he'd be a big man someday, and getting a big turkey for his mother was the way in which he could show that he is a big man.<s>
The store had all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish.<s>
Mitch ran for the turkey section of the store with much force.<s>
"Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I want to eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!"<s>
Mitch would cry out to strangers he met in the turkey section of the store.<s>
Then, four and a half seconds later, Mitch turned into a giant Walrus named Ted!<s>
No one knew how this could have happened, but the Walrus knew.<s>
A few years later, Mitch the now giant Walrus named Ted joined the circus and became a rich man with green in his heart.<s>
He could not think of anything else but making more money at his circus.<s>
One day Ted the giant Walrus, also known as Mitch the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast.<s>
Now that Ted was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast.<s>
Ted the walrus also remembered that he had earlier built a time machine.<s>
