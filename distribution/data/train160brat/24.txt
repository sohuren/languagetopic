Chocolate was a box turtle.<s>
Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.<s>
Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.<s>
After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.<s>
Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.<s>
Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.<s>
Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad.<s>
Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.<s>
Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, "Lauren, get in here now!"<s>
Lauren knew she was in trouble.<s>
But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.<s>
Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.<s>
Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.<s>
The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's eyes.<s>
Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better.<s>
Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings.<s>
Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.<s>
