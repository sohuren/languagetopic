Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting.<s>
Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach!<s>
They were going to go swimming.<s>
Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach.<s>
After their picnic lunch, Tim's mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.<s>
Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van.<s>
His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls.<s>
They were only 4 years old.<s>
Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach.<s>
To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit.<s>
Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions.<s>
Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.<s>
When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny.<s>
The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore.<s>
It made a lovely noise.<s>
It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.<s>
When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner.<s>
They ate and ate.<s>
They ate macaroni salad.<s>
Then they ate some cold chicken.<s>
They also had lemon pie for dessert.<s>
Tim's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs.<s>
Tim thought it was a very good day.<s>
