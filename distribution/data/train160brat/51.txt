Jenny was a 13 year old girl with blond hair and blue eyes.<s>
She had gotten out of her last day of school and was free for the summer.<s>
Two of her friends were going to the nearby beach to do some swimming and enjoy the sun.<s>
Jenny went with them and when they got there the beach was very full and there were people everywhere.<s>
They changed into their bathing suits and went to the water.<s>
The water was very cold.<s>
They chose not swim and walked to the sand.<s>
Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun.<s>
After several hours Jenny and her friends fell asleep.<s>
They woke up and the sun was beginning to set.<s>
When Jenny sat up she found that it was painful to touch her skin.<s>
When she looked down she saw that she had a very bad sunburn.<s>
Her friends were also very badly sunburned so they went home.<s>
Jenny's mother gave her a cream to put on the sunburn.<s>
Afterwards she felt a lot better and went to sleep.<s>
