There was once a land named Catatonia where cats ran things.<s>
Cats walked and talked much as you do except they walked on four legs.<s>
There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver.<s>
Most of the cats were very busy.<s>
The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs.<s>
He had two brothers named Pouncer and Flash who helped him rule in Catatonia.<s>
Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream center and Flash's job was to blow things up.<s>
Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.<s>
One day Pouncer's wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office.<s>
There were white kittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese and Cream center.<s>
Well that is all the time we have for now.<s>
I hope this short story of the Cats of Catatonia made at least one person in the room smile.<s>
