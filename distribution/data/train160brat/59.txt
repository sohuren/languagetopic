Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present.<s>
He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood.<s>
Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max.<s>
Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase.<s>
They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek.<s>
They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water.<s>
One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him.<s>
Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest.<s>
Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.<s>
After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed.<s>
He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy.<s>
Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle.<s>
The dogs were having so much fun.<s>
Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back.<s>
Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend.<s>
All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.<s>
