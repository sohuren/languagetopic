Cindy and Mary were playing at recess.<s>
They were having a great time until Cindy brought up Allison's birthday party.<s>
Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not.<s>
This hurt Mary's feelings a lot.<s>
The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying.<s>
She couldn't believe that she had not been invited to Allison's birthday party.<s>
She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?<s>
After recess was over, the class walked back into the school.<s>
Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard.<s>
Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.<s>
Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now.<s>
She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party.<s>
Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her?<s>
She couldn't understand it.<s>
Her eyes started to get wet with tears.<s>
She was hoping that no one saw this.<s>
Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way.<s>
Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying.<s>
She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues.<s>
She felt a strange  piece of paper.<s>
She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party.<s>
It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk.<s>
She immediately started to smile.<s>
She smiled at Allison and at Cindy.<s>
Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.<s>
At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy.<s>
Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.<s>
