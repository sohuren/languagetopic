Hannah and her friend Mary were bored.<s>
They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do.<s>
They petted the cat.<s>
They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook.<s>
They snuck into Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them.<s>
She said, "You girls need something to do.<s>
Let's take a walk to the park!"<s>
Hannah and Mary looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.<s>
"The park sounds great!"<s>
said Hannah.<s>
"Let's go!"<s>
cried Mary.<s>
So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.<s>
They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way.<s>
Mary spotted a squirrel.<s>
Hannah saw a yellow bird.<s>
Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr. Smith's house.<s>
When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack.<s>
Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks.<s>
When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a trash can.<s>
As they walked back home, Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out quite well.<s>
