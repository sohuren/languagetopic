Luna the hawk wanted some socks.<s>
It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches made her feet very cold.<s>
Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks.<s>
She flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived.<s>
"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"<s>
she asked.<s>
Olive the owl looked surprised.<s>
"Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers.<s>
Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs.<s>
They might have extra socks you could borrow."<s>
Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek.<s>
Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws.<s>
The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun.<s>
"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"<s>
begged Luna.<s>
Rose laughed hard.<s>
"Silly Luna, I do not have socks.<s>
Look at my legs and feet.<s>
They are covered with thick, warm fur.<s>
I'm sorry I cannot help you.<s>
Go visit the humans.<s>
Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food.<s>
Once I saw a pair of socks."<s>
Luna was very afraid of humans.<s>
Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them.<s>
She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks.<s>
Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches.<s>
She became brave.<s>
She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill.<s>
When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes.<s>
She saw socks!<s>
In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks.<s>
The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins.<s>
Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins.<s>
She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree.<s>
When she landed, her feet were warm and dry.<s>
Luna was very happy.<s>
