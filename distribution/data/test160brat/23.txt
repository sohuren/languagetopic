One day Magneson took a walk in the park.<s>
He passed some trees and a pond.<s>
In the pond was a duck named George.<s>
George's wife was also in the pond.<s>
Her name was Nancy.<s>
Magneson walked over to the tree.<s>
Nancy flew up into the tree.<s>
She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.<s>
A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.<s>
He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.<s>
He was never seen again.<s>
Magneson asked what their son's name was.<s>
They said it was Leonard.<s>
But Magneson was only making small talk.<s>
He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.<s>
Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.<s>
He could also hide in the tall grass.<s>
George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.<s>
They flew away, singing a sad song.<s>
A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.<s>
No one ever saw Magneson again.<s>
