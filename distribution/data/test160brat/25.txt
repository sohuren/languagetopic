Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.<s>
The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.<s>
So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.<s>
He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.<s>
Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.<s>
The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.<s>
He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.<s>
Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.<s>
So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.<s>
The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!<s>
Here Wolfie!!!"<s>
, to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.<s>
But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.<s>
He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.<s>
