On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park.<s>
While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.<s>
Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.<s>
Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow.<s>
The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.<s>
Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money.<s>
He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.<s>
He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.<s>
Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.<s>
After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.<s>
Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work.<s>
He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.<s>
His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.<s>
Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money.<s>
When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.<s>
Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.<s>
Brian was so happy, and he and his dad spent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.<s>
