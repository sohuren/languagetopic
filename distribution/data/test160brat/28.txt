Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles.<s>
Puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats.<s>
Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group.<s>
He found it very boring and Puddles was sad.<s>
Puddles didn't even look like a cat!<s>
All of the other cats teased Puddles.<s>
"You're too big," they said.<s>
"You've got too long of a nose!"<s>
"Why are you panting like that?"<s>
Puddles knew that he was different.<s>
One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats.<s>
The cats laughed at him.<s>
What a stupid dog!<s>
Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?<s>
Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.<s>
So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods.<s>
He was finally happy!<s>
All of a sudden, Puddles turned.<s>
He smelled a funny smell.<s>
It smelled like something he had never smelled before.<s>
He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!<s>
Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy.<s>
He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family.<s>
Puddles was never lonely again.<s>
