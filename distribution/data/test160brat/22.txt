It was a beautiful sunny and warm day.<s>
I was working outside in my garden.<s>
I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day.<s>
I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake.<s>
It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.<s>
On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake.<s>
I got up from my garden and walked to the lake.<s>
I kept hearing this strange sound.<s>
It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice.<s>
I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time.<s>
The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds.<s>
There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short.<s>
Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud.<s>
But this sound was not like any I had ever heard.<s>
I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything.<s>
But, no luck.<s>
I still kept hearing this low talking sound.<s>
I had now totally given up weeding.<s>
Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun.<s>
But where was it coming from?<s>
I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing.<s>
Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats.<s>
There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water.<s>
I spotted them!<s>
It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them.<s>
They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish.<s>
The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish.<s>
I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.<s>
I felt very special that I got to see this.<s>
It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.<s>
