On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach.<s>
When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure.<s>
To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets.<s>
They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels.<s>
After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn't find anything.<s>
This made Bob and Sally very sad.<s>
They gave up and went to play in the water.<s>
While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside.<s>
Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map.<s>
Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure.<s>
After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels.<s>
After digging a really a big hole, they found a box.<s>
They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside.<s>
Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.<s>
Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl.<s>
The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich.<s>
Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it.<s>
They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.<s>
