Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to leave because of her mean mother.<s>
One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let her.<s>
The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall when her mother was sleeping.<s>
She wandered out a good ways.<s>
Finally she went into the forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.<s>
There she met a young man who was running.<s>
His name was John.<s>
John asked the princess why such a beautiful woman like her was out in the middle of a forest.<s>
She said that she had been trapped for her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother.<s>
The man said that he would take the princess to a castle that was near.<s>
He also said that he thought that she may be the missing princess.<s>
As they go through the forest they run into many problems.<s>
They see that they are lost and have no way of finding where to go.<s>
After several days pass, the princess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are.<s>
She sees that the castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain.<s>
After thinking of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for the rest of their lives.<s>
