On the third day of November, Ron and Pam went to the store.<s>
They wanted to get some food for a new recipe.<s>

Ron was to get the pasta and tomato sauce, and Pam was to get the vegetables and juice.<s>

He asked Pam what he needs to feed the bunny.<s>
Pam told him lettuce and carrots, so he put 5 heads of lettuce in his basket along with one bag of carrots.<s>
Tom said goodbye to Pam and went to the front of the store to buy his vegetables.<s>
Now it was time for Pam to pick out the vegetables she would buy for dinner.<s>

Pam then went to where they kept the juice and grabbed a big bottle of lemonade.<s>
