"How are you asleep?<s>
It's six in the morning!"<s>
"Hello Dad," I said.<s>
My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat.<s>
I wished we could hang out at night instead.<s>
He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face, with a big shopping bag on his lap.<s>
"What's in the bag, Dad?"<s>
"I bought you some presents!<s>
You're a growing young man, and it is only right that you pick a sport."<s>
Dad dug through the bag, and pulled out a football and a baseball.<s>
"Any of these look good?"<s>
"Dad, you know all I want in life is to join the circus!<s>
Why can't you let me be myself?"<s>
Dad leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face.<s>
"Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too.<s>
But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me.<s>
They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day.<s>
They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams."<s>
"Then how did you find Mom?"<s>
"By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead!<s>
Come on, you'll like it."<s>
I slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from Dad's hand.<s>
I wanted to make him happy.<s>
But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you didn't get hit with things.<s>
