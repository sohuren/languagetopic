Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house.<s>
He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was.<s>
As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur.<s>
Then he saw a tongue.<s>
After that, some more fur and then slurp!<s>
He was licked again!<s>
"Oh, Boscoe!"<s>
the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog.<s>
The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember.<s>
They went on many adventures together.<s>
The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way.<s>
One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12.<s>
Scott wanted to have a little fun.<s>
He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe.<s>
Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle.<s>
Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house.<s>
He wanted to do a little adventuring.<s>
Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off!<s>
Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about.<s>
All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water.<s>
Scott yelled, "Boscoe!"<s>
and he was off.<s>
He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe.<s>
Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope!<s>
Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!<s>
As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river.<s>
"Boy, was that close!"<s>
Scott yelled out loud!<s>
That was the best adventure ever!<s>
