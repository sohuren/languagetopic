One day, the mouse, Rudd, got a splinter in his paw when he was putting a new fence around his house.<s>
His turtle friend with a weird name, Dig, came up to Rudd after he heard him yelling, "Ouch, I've got a splinter in my paw!<s>
Can someone help?"<s>
Dig, being the ever helpful turtle, took the splinter in his mouth and tugged it.<s>
The splinter popped right out of Rudd's paw and flew right into the air and then landed in the middle of the river.<s>
Rudd looked happy and gave Dig a hug.<s>
"Thank you so much, Dig!<s>
And for helping me, I'll give you the choice of one of these three desserts I found.<s>
What would you like to have?<s>
A cake?<s>
A cookie?<s>
Or maybe this brownie?"<s>
"Oh, Rudd, you are so silly and know you don't even have to ask me which one I'd take.<s>
You know I love brownies!"<s>
Dig smiled happily as Rudd gave him his treat and another hug for helping with the splinter.<s>
After the two friends finish their dessert, Dig helped Rudd put up the rest of his fence until the sun went down that day.<s>
It was a good day for both friends.<s>
