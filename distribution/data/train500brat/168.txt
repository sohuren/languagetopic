A family of four went to the zoo today.<s>
The animal zoo they were going to had a bunch of different kinds of animals!<s>
The kids were so excited to go that they had almost forgot to bring their camera.<s>
They arrived to the zoo and the first thing they saw were the flamingos!<s>
They were so pretty and pink.<s>
They all stood around very silently and looked at the people.<s>
The next animal they saw were the lions.<s>
They were so scary looking that the kids were scared to walk close to the fence.<s>
After the lions were the giraffes.<s>
They were so tall, the kids had to lean all the way back to see them.<s>
The kids were hungry so they went to go eat lunch.<s>
The family had a bunch of food such as pizza, burgers, chicken fingers, and fries.<s>
After lunch, they went to see the monkeys.<s>
They were so loud and smelly.<s>
Some of the monkeys went right up to the glass to look at the people.<s>
The family took a break after seeing the monkeys as they were tired from all the walking.<s>
The park was so big that they had so many more animals to see!<s>
Their feet started hurting, so the family went to see a few more animals.<s>
They went home after a really fun day at the zoo.<s>
They had seen a lot of animals they never would have seen outside of the zoo.<s>
They loved the zoo so much they wanted to go back next week!<s>
The parents said they would come back soon to see how the animals were doing.<s>
