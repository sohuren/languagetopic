Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday.<s>
When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots.<s>
The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow.<s>
He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.<s>
When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence.<s>
The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.<s>
Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come.<s>
Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared.<s>
All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food.<s>
After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef.<s>
The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars.<s>
Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner.<s>
His brother was very happy with the dinner.<s>
Billy's mom was also very happy.<s>
