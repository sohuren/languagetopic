Lucy was a young lady bug.<s>
She always felt different from the lady bugs because her colors were reversed!<s>
Instead of a red body and black spots she had a black body and red spots!<s>

"What happened?!"<s>
asked Lucy.<s>
"I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since.<s>
I can't fly because my wing is broken.<s>
Do you know the way back home?"<s>
asked Jessie "Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!"<s>
Lucy said happily.<s>
"Thank you so much!"<s>
Jessie said happily.<s>
Lucy led Jessie straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing.<s>
She was rewarded a medal and called a hero.<s>
