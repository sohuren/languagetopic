The road to Grandpa's house was long and winding.<s>
There were lots of tall trees and animals in the woods.<s>
The trip took a long time because Jimmy was walking in his new boots and he wasn't used to them yet.<s>
He could have taken a ride to Grandpa's house, but that wouldn't be as fun.<s>
Jimmy liked to collect insects on the way to his Grandpa's house, so had picked the longer path.<s>
As he went along, Jimmy found more and more insects to add to his jar.<s>
His favorite was the lightning bug and he had found five of them total.<s>
He liked the moths too, but they were difficult to catch and took up a lot of space.<s>
Finally, Jimmy arrived at Grandpa's house and knocked.<s>
Grandpa answered the door with a smile and welcomed Jimmy inside.<s>
They sat by the fire and talked about the insects.<s>
They watched the lightning bugs light up as night came.<s>
