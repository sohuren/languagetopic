I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables.<s>
It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds!<s>
The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden.<s>
We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them.<s>
Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes.<s>
Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten.<s>
Every day they would get even bigger.<s>
That was the most exciting part!<s>
Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes.<s>
And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red.<s>
This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner.<s>
