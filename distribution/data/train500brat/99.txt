Marcel lived on a farm.<s>
Every morning when he woke up, he got dressed, washed his face, and then helped his Pa with the chores before having breakfast.<s>
After breakfast, he walked with his sisters to the school in the town.<s>
One day on his way to school, Marcel remembered he left his books on the table.<s>
"Oh no!"<s>
he said.<s>
"I forgot my books!"<s>
His older sister Lucianne frowned.<s>
"Oh, Marcel, how could you be so forgetful?<s>
You'll have to go home and get them."<s>
Marcel's younger sister Paula was excited.<s>
"I can go get your books for you," she said.<s>
"No," Marcel said.<s>
"You're too young to go home by yourself.<s>
It'll have to be me."<s>
"Be careful," Lucianne warned him.<s>
"And hurry, or you'll be late for school."<s>
Marcel chose to leave the road so he could get home faster.<s>
So he left the road and ran into the grassy pasture, passing by a group of lambs.<s>
The shepherd waved at him as he ran past.<s>
