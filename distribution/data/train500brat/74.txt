Lucy was walking with her family in the woods, far away from the city.<s>
Her father helped her see all kinds of animals.<s>
It was like going to the zoo.<s>
They saw deer, a moose, a fox, and a bear.<s>
The bear ran away when her brother shouted.<s>
Lucy thought that was lucky, because she was a little scared of it.<s>
Her father showed her a whistle to blow in case she got lost.<s>
Her brother kept stealing it.<s>
While they were walking down by a stream, Lucy's Mom was making sandwiches for everyone.<s>
Lucy's brother Jim kept blowing the whistle.<s>
He told her that he was going to steal her sandwich if he got there first.<s>
That made her mad!<s>
She really wanted her turkey sandwich and not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<s>
When their mom called, they both ran back as fast as they could.<s>
Since Jim was older, he was faster and beat her to the picnic.<s>
Lucy started crying.<s>
She thought Jim stole everything!<s>
