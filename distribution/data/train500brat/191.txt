One morning, Becca was putting on her shoes when she heard a knock at the door.<s>
When she opened it, she saw her friend Faith standing on the porch.<s>
"Bill is going to build a fort in my backyard today, and I get to help," Faith said.<s>
"Would you like to come over and help too?"<s>
Becca thought about what she had to do that day.<s>
Her mother had told her she needed to get her chores done before she could play at Faith's house.<s>
"First, I have to clean my room," Becca told Faith.<s>
"Maybe I can help you," Faith said.<s>
"I helped Sam clean his room once."<s>
"Sure!"<s>
Becca answered.<s>
The girls went to Becca's room and started to pick up toys and clothes.<s>
"Maybe I need to clean under the bed," Becca said.<s>
Under the bed, she found a library book she had been missing.<s>
Faith finished putting all of the clothes into the hamper.<s>
"Thanks for the help!"<s>
Becca said.<s>
"Now I can go with you."<s>
"I hope we don't have to clean my room, too!"<s>
said Faith.<s>
