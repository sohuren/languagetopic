John woke up.<s>
It was Tuesday, and he was at home.<s>
He was still sleepy, but his alarm clock was ringing and he knew he had to be on time for school.<s>
He wished it were Saturday or Sunday.<s>
He yawned, got out of bed, and put on his slippers.<s>
Then, he walked to the bathroom, where he brushed his teeth and washed his face.<s>
Still in his pajamas, he went down to the kitchen.<s>
His mother, Sylvia, greeted him with a glass of orange juice and a big bowl of cereal.<s>
He was still kind of sleepy, but he drank his juice and ate his cereal.<s>
When John was done with his breakfast, he went upstairs and got his school clothes on.<s>
Then it was time to catch the bus to school.<s>
John hated the bus, because he was quiet and the bus was always loud.<s>
Plus there was always some kid who thought it was funny to make gross jokes or say bad words.<s>
Today, John was ready for the bus.<s>
With the sandwich and potato chips in his lunchbox, he had some cake he had made yesterday.<s>
He had used salt to make the cake instead of sugar.<s>
He knew it tasted horrible, and he was going to give a piece of cake to the first person who was bad on the bus, and he didn't even care if he got in trouble.<s>
His friends Anne, Margaret, and Charlotte were in on it, too.<s>
He sat in the house, a little excited, eating an apple and waiting until it was time to leave the house.<s>
It was time!<s>
He put on his shoes and left.<s>
