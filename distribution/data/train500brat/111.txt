Will was playing his favorite song.<s>
The song was about a flower.<s>
Will stopped singing and went outside.<s>
A single star was out in the night sky.<s>
Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.<s>
He also had jam with it.<s>
He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.<s>
Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.<s>
Will walked over to the living room.<s>
On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.<s>
When he was in the living room, it started to rain.<s>
It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.<s>
When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.<s>
Will heard it start to thunder.<s>
Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.<s>
Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.<s>
He went outside smiling.<s>
