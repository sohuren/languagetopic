One morning, Elena woke up, much like she did every day.<s>
She threw the covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely.<s>
She walked to the window and said, "Hello there, Mr. tree!"<s>
at the big tree in the yard.<s>
It waved its branches back at her.<s>
She walked over to her fish bowl next.<s>
"Hello there, Mr. Fish!"<s>
But wait.<s>
Where was Mr. Fish?<s>
The bowl was empty--oh, the rocks and water and tiny castle were all there alright, but the pretty blue fish with the long shiny tail was nowhere to be seen.<s>
Elena was very worried.<s>
She liked Mr. Fish very much.<s>
She looked all around her desk, but here wasn't there.<s>
Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was!<s>
He was covered in dust bunnies and not moving.<s>
Elena picked him up and put him back in the bowl.<s>
And what do you know?<s>
He shook himself off and started swimming around again!<s>
