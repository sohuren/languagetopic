Once there was a guy who lived in a giant red mitten.<s>
He was always mad because the old woman in the shoe down the road got all the attention for living in a giant piece of clothing.<s>
One day he made a plan to play a joke.<s>
He took a cookie and with it in his hand went to dig a hole under the old lady's shoe.<s>
When he finished digging he hid the cookie in the hole and then went to the zoo.<s>
He stole a bunch of monkeys which he took back to the lady's shoe house.<s>
The TV news team was talking to her on camera that day outside her house about how great she was for living in a shoe and how smart and cool she was.<s>
The guy stood there listening with his bag of hungry monkeys.<s>
At the very second the news team took a close up of the shoe with their big camera the guy opened the bag and freed the monkeys.<s>
He had told them earlier that hidden somewhere in the house was a cookie.<s>
He laughed very loud as he imagined them tearing up her house on live TV.<s>
But instead of doing that, they stood around looking bored because monkeys like bananas not cookies.<s>
