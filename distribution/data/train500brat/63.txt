Last Saturday was the best day of Timmy's summer.<s>
After waking up at nine and turning on his lamp, Timmy ran downstairs, counting the steps as he always did.<s>
There were always seven.<s>
At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean.<s>
Timmy took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom Suzie had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail.<s>
Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him.<s>
It was here!<s>
Timmy's birthday present from his grandmother Betty had arrived.<s>
He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad Ryan was waiting for him with a grin on his face.<s>
As Timmy tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for.<s>
It was a huge water gun!<s>
Timmy immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing.<s>
His neighbor Maeby came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight!<s>
Soon, Timmy's dad came outside to play too!<s>
He brought 11 water balloons.<s>
Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other.<s>
Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there.<s>
It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water.<s>
Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families.<s>
