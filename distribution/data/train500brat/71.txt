Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train.<s>
Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on.<s>
He thought this was the best time of his life.<s>
He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric.<s>
Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar.<s>
Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur.<s>
His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty.<s>
If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house.<s>
Max didn't mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train.<s>
The funny thing about Max was that he didn't like going for a drive with Bob in a car, on a bike or in a boat.<s>
The only way you get Max to go somewhere was on a train.<s>
Max must have been a train driver in a past life.<s>
