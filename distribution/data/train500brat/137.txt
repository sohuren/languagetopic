There once was a beautiful princess named Lizzie who lived in a castle in the woods.<s>
One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.<s>
Her mother's birthday was the next day.<s>
If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother.<s>
Her mother's name was Queen Alice.<s>
As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.<s>
There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.<s>
There were some deer drinking water from the pond.<s>
She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.<s>
The lilies were white and yellow and red.<s>
She picked 12 lilies for her mother.<s>
Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.<s>
There were birds building a nest in the bushes.<s>
Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left.<s>
There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too.<s>
The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.<s>
She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.<s>
She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods.<s>
In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.<s>
She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods.<s>
She heard someone calling her name and was very happy to see her father standing near her.<s>
When she opened her eyes she also could see her brother Henry standing near her.<s>
She could hear their dog, Daisy, rushing to meet them, too.<s>
