Paul the pear lived in a bowl on the table.<s>
He was a plastic fruit, and no one could eat him.<s>
He sat in the bowl with Artie the apple and Gertie the grapes.<s>
He watched every day as the group of bananas that hung out in another basket got eaten one by one.<s>
He wished he could be taken along to work in a bag and brought along to eat.<s>
But day after day, he sat in the bowl with only his plastic friends.<s>
One day, a little boy walked over towards him and picked Paul up.<s>
Paul was very excited.<s>
The boy looked at the pear with hungry eyes.<s>
He put him up to his mouth and took a big bite.<s>
"Ewwww!!!"<s>
said the little boy, and he spit out the fake fruit all over the floor.<s>
He put Paul back in the bowl and ran away.<s>
Paul smiled to himself about his adventure.<s>
