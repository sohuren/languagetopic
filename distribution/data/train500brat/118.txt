One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family.<s>
She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.<s>
Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.<s>
Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.<s>
Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.<s>
For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.<s>
Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.<s>
She cried more and more until one day she got brave.<s>
She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.<s>
She got off the ride and loved it!<s>
Her mom said to her, "Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!"<s>
Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.<s>
For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.<s>
The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.<s>
His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.<s>
Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.<s>
When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.<s>
She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!<s>
Now was the real test.<s>
Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.<s>
She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.<s>
At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.<s>
Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.<s>
She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.<s>
Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.<s>
