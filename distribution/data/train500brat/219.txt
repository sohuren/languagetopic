There once was a lion who did not roar, but instead he said meow.<s>
The lion was sad, because he could not roar like his other lion friends.<s>
The lion went to talk to his family.<s>
He first went to talk to his brother, but his brother was not home.<s>
Then he went to talk to his dad, but his dad was not home either.<s>
Luckily, the lion's sister was home.<s>
He asked his sister why he thought he could not roar.<s>
His sister said they need to go talk to their friend the squirrel.<s>
The squirrel lived in a tree with a nice door mat outside.<s>
The squirrel said to the lion if he wanted to start to roar instead of meow, then he need to run faster than the other lion's.<s>
So the next day, the lion played a game, in which he ran faster than all the other lions.<s>
Now, the lion roars and doesn't meow.<s>
