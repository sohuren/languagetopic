Janice spent the weekend at a family party in Moore, Georgia.<s>
While she was there, she played with her cousin Justine.<s>
The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together.<s>
Janice's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with Justine and her dog, Boots.<s>
Boots did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them.<s>
His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water.<s>
They also went on a fast boat around the lake.<s>
Justine's favorite thing to do was ride in a tube behind the boat.<s>
When they got out, they were soaking wet.<s>
They dried off with towels before going to Greg's Country Store for some lemon ice box cake.<s>
Boots got so muddy at the lake!<s>
When they got back to the cabin, they had to give him a bath.<s>
Because they were so active during the day, they fell asleep quickly and slept until the morning.<s>
