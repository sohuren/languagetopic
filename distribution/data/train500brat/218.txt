When I was a little girl I lived in a place with no winter.<s>
It was always warm there.<s>
It never got cold.<s>
It never snowed.<s>
Sometimes it rained.<s>
Sometimes there was wind.<s>
But there was no snow on the trees or on the ground.<s>
There was no snow falling on our heads.<s>
There was no snow to make a snowman.<s>
My teacher's name was Mrs. Scott.<s>
One day in December, Mrs. Scott told us that we were going to make a snowman.<s>
We were excited!<s>
We wanted to see a snowman.<s>
We knew how a snowman looked.<s>
We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs.<s>
A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons.<s>
A snowman had a hat and a scarf.<s>
We knew all these things.<s>
Mrs. Scott asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman.<s>
Jimmy said, "I can bring the hat and the scarf."<s>
Anita said, "I can bring a carrot for the nose."<s>
Selma said, "I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons."<s>
Ricky asked, "But who can bring the snow?"<s>
Mrs. Scott said, "I know what to do."<s>
The next day all the children brought the things for the snowman.<s>
We did not know where Mrs. Scott would get the snow.<s>
Then she showed us.<s>
Our snowman is made of three bushes!<s>
Three bushes painted white!<s>
We put all the things on the bushes and it looked like a real snowman.<s>
