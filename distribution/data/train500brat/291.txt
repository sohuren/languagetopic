They would go to the park and he could push her on the swing then they could take their dog for a walk and have a long talk like they used to do.<s>

"What are you two doing in here?"<s>
Their mom asked.<s>
"We are waiting to help you with Dad's cake."<s>
Juan said.<s>
"Okay, you two get out the yogurt for the frosting and I am going to start the oven to get it warmer."<s>
"Oh no!<s>
I spilled the punch when Juan was closing the door."<s>
Amy cried.<s>
"It is okay we can clean that up in no time."<s>
Juan said and grabbed the paper towels.<s>
Just as their mom was mixing the cake ingredients Juan and Amy heard their dog bark.<s>
"Mom!<s>
The dog is barking someone is here."<s>
Juan said.<s>
"Well your dad is not going to be here until this afternoon.<s>
You two wait here."<s>
She said and walked out of the kitchen.<s>

She hugged him and they walked into the kitchen together.<s>
"Daddy!"<s>
Juan and Amy shouted and ran to hug him.<s>
"I missed you guys so I left early."<s>
