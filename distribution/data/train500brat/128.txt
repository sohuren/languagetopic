Once upon a time there was a boy monster named Jerry who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks.<s>
He had lived there all his life.<s>
Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36.<s>
Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe.<s>
She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby.<s>
The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there.<s>
Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there.<s>
Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born.<s>
By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines.<s>
They ate food from the fields outside of town.<s>
Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn.<s>
They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals.<s>
One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been.<s>
His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge.<s>
Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him.<s>
This made Jerry very sad.<s>
He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed.<s>
After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father.<s>
He packed some food and left.<s>
When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.<s>
