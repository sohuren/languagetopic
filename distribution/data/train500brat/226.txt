Jason lay in his bed after a night of no sleep.<s>
He was too excited for today.<s>
There was a football game that he was going to play with his friends.<s>
It would be him, Jack, James, and John competing with David, Ruth, Parsons, and Mike.<s>
David, Rush, Parsons, and Mike were much bigger than them, and were big bullies at school.<s>
When Jason got up, he had the choice to eat cereal, candy, chocolate milk, or pizza.<s>
He chose to eat cereal because he thought that eating something good for you would make him play better.<s>
They were going to play at the school, but the school was closed.<s>
They then went to the park, and got their teams set up.<s>
Jason's team got the ball first and they scored!<s>
David's team got the ball next, but they also scored.<s>
Unfortunately, it started raining.<s>
Everyone was getting wet, and people were starting to get angry.<s>
A fight soon broke out, and they all started fighting with each other.<s>
Eventually, Jason yelled for everyone to stop.<s>
They all stopped and chose to eat pizza together and forgive each other.<s>
Jason then went home bruised and dirty, and his parents grounded him for getting into a fight.<s>
