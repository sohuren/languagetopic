Kyle was excited.<s>
So excited that he ate and got dressed before his dad even woke up.<s>
Today he was going to the store to spend the money his grandma had sent him for his birthday.<s>
When Dad was finally ready to go, Kyle hurried to the car.<s>
Today was extra special because none of his sisters were going with them.<s>
His older sister Sandy was visiting her best friend.<s>
His younger sister Sarah was going to a movie with their mom.<s>
So today was a special day, only Kyle and Dad being guys together.<s>
Once they reached the store, Kyle walked slowly down each aisle, looking at all the toys and trying to find the best one.<s>
Purple superheroes, colorful games, and a bright blue ball all caught his eye, but Kyle kept looking.<s>
Finally he saw it, hiding on the bottom shelf.<s>
The most perfect toy- a shiny, white jeep.<s>
Kyle rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad.<s>
His dad thought the jeep was a great toy.<s>
And Kyle had enough money to buy it.<s>
The clerk took Kyle's money and placed the perfect car into a bag for the boy.<s>
As they drove home, Kyle looked into the bag at his dream toy several times, to make sure it was real.<s>
And all afternoon he pretended to drive his jeep around the house.<s>
This had been the best day ever!<s>
