Sean the dragon liked the color green.<s>
He didn't like golden coins.<s>
They were too yellow.<s>
Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure.<s>
He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave.<s>
The other dragons were worried.<s>
When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.<s>
They were afraid Sean might get hurt.<s>
Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.<s>
One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace.<s>
"What's that?"<s>
he asked.<s>
"That's a green stone," she told him.<s>
"Sometimes my treasures have them.<s>
I don't really like them.<s>
They're too green.<s>
I like yellow things."<s>
"If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?"<s>
Sean asked.<s>
"Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."<s>
So Sean went to go find treasure.<s>
When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons.<s>
They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.<s>
Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.<s>
Green stones never got old and brown.<s>
They don't catch fire either.<s>
So, now everyone was happy.<s>
