A tiger named Timmy and Bear named Buster were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later.<s>
As Timmy was running through a field in the park he came upon a small hamster with a broken leg.<s>
The hamster looked like it had somewhere to go but couldn't make it because of its leg.<s>
Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help.<s>
As they talked, Timmy and Buster started to become good friends with the hamster.<s>
They found out his name was Henry.<s>
Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it.<s>
Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it.<s>
After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water.<s>
They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.<s>
