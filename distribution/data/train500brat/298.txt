Once there was a boy named Bill who liked to play at being a cowboy.<s>
One day he was playing at chasing Indians in his room when he heard a loud crack of thunder.<s>
He got really scared.<s>
Bill's parents, Ned and Susan, came into his room.<s>
They told him not to be scared.<s>
They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon.<s>
Bill said okay.<s>
He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside.<s>
He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents weren't back yet.<s>
His brother Zack had given him the gun.<s>
Bill started to think he could hear voices in the wind.<s>
It sounded like a strange kind of chanting.<s>
He started to shake and hug his toy gun.<s>
He said, "I'm not afraid of you.<s>
If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you."<s>
After that he felt a little better.<s>
But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut.<s>
He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt.<s>
He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room.<s>
He was worried that it was on fire, but he couldn't smell any smoke.<s>
