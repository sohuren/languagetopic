James the Turtle was always getting in trouble.<s>
Sometimes he'd reach into the freezer and empty out all the food.<s>
Other times he'd sled on the deck and get a splinter.<s>
His aunt Jane tried as hard as she could to keep him out of trouble, but he was sneaky and got into lots of trouble behind her back.<s>
One day, James thought he would go into town and see what kind of trouble he could get into.<s>
He went to the grocery store and pulled all the pudding off the shelves and ate two jars.<s>
Then he walked to the fast food restaurant and ordered 15 bags of fries.<s>
He didn't pay, and instead headed home.<s>
His aunt was waiting for him in his room.<s>
She told James that she loved him, but he would have to start acting like a well-behaved turtle.<s>
After about a month, and after getting into lots of trouble, James finally made up his mind to be a better turtle.<s>
