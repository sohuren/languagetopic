Mike didn't want to see them at all, he wanted to see the monkeys.<s>
Their mother told them that they can see all of the animals, but they have to start with the sneaky snakes.<s>

"Look!<s>
Mike," their mother said, "those monkeys are dancing for you!"<s>
and Mike watched them happily dance and dance!<s>
When they stopped dancing, their mother told Jane it was time to see some scary lions and bears.<s>
