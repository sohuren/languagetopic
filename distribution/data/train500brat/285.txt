Ralph the bee wanted to go visit his friend George the fly.<s>
George lived very far away, it would a long trip for Ralph.<s>
Ralph first flew over a jungle, in the jungle he met a nice tiger by the name of Benny.<s>
Benny wanted to play but Ralph had no time, he still had a long way to go.<s>
Then Ralph flew by a lake.<s>
At the lake he met a cowboy.<s>
The cowboy was named Walter.<s>
Walter was letting his horse get a drink of water from the lake.<s>
The horse drank a lot and when he was done he let out a huge burp.<s>
Ralph waved goodbye to Walter and his horse.<s>
Ralph then stopped for lunch, he had some bread he brought with him from home.<s>
While he was sitting when all of the sudden a pig walked up to him.<s>
He did not get the pigs name, because the pig could only say oink.<s>
Finally, after a long trip, Ralph finally got to the house of George the fly.<s>
George wanted to play, but Ralph was too tired.<s>
So Ralph went to sleep.<s>
