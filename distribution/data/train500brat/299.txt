This summer Frank and his friends went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks.<s>
At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories.<s>
At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals.<s>
One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp.<s>
But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead.<s>
Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat.<s>
Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing.<s>
They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.<s>
At first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp.<s>
She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear.<s>
She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys.<s>
She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks.<s>
But Frank's scout masters explained to Frank's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for Frank.<s>
Frank promised to call home at least every two days.<s>
So in the end Frank's mom let Frank go to camp.<s>
