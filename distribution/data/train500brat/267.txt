I couldn't believe today had come!<s>
It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store.<s>
First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday!<s>
Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me.<s>
Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets.<s>
I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!<s>
\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone.<s>
Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right.<s>
Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day.<s>
I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them!<s>
Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day.<s>
It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow!<s>
