There once was a doggy named Jack that was really bored.<s>
One day he was sitting on the sofa he thought to himself, "Maybe I'll go for a ride."<s>
The dog put on his shoes and hat and walked out of the door.<s>
He began riding down the street and he saw a lot of funny things.<s>
He saw a pumpkin name Sue using toothpaste, a cat name Walt watching a movie and a bear name Phil cooking on a grill.<s>
On his drive back home he saw a rat name Randy, and a lion name Leo riding a bike.<s>
When the doggy got back home he wanted to write a book about all of the things that he saw.<s>
He went into his office and gathered the pen and paper, sat down and began writing.<s>
After hours of writing he felt that his leg was hurting from being bent under the table so long.<s>
He wrote his last sentence and got up to walk off the pain.<s>
The doggy cooked his dinner, ate, then went to bed and the next day he woke up and read his story and liked what he wrote so much that he thought he would write another story later that day.<s>
