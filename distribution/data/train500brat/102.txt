Steve had a very long finger.<s>
It was the longest finger anyone in his town had.<s>
One day Steve shut the toilet seat, and his finger got caught in it.<s>
He couldn't get it out.<s>
It was very cold in the bathroom.<s>
This is why his sister brought him a coat.<s>
He was in the bathroom a long time.<s>
So, Steve started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush.<s>
Then he wrote the truth on this stone.<s>
He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue.<s>
He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling.<s>
He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister.<s>
It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone.<s>
So he let her see his power.<s>
With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up.<s>
He could make things move with his mind.<s>
