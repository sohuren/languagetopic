One morning, Daddy, Ethan, and I went out shopping for Mother's day gifts.<s>
First we went to buy some flowers.<s>
I found a nice big bunch of pink roses that were very pretty.<s>
Then we went and bought a card.<s>
There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.<s>
Daddy wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but Ethan wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.<s>
We ended up getting all three.<s>
Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.<s>
On Mother's day I helped Daddy make breakfast.<s>
We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.<s>
It was very messy but a lot of fun.<s>
Mommy loved getting breakfast in bed and she liked the flowers and cards.<s>
We also went out to go to the park after breakfast.<s>
It was a beautiful day and a lot of fun.<s>
I can't wait for mother's day to come by again!<s>
