Hailey stood in her kitchen.<s>
She was looking for ideas of what to make for dinner.<s>
She could make pasta, soup, chili, or steak.<s>
She opened the refrigerator and took out a cartoon of juice.<s>
She sat down at the table and tried to write a list of ingredients she would need.<s>
She finally thought she would make chili for dinner.<s>
She took a sip of her juice and she saw she had all the ingredients she needed except meat.<s>
Hailey saw she was losing daylight.<s>
This made her want to take her car to the store in order to buy the meat.<s>
It would be faster than walking.<s>
She quickly went to the back of the store where she knew the meat was stored and took her find to the cashier.<s>
When she made her way back into the lot she ran into her friend, Beth, and invited Beth to come to her house for dinner.<s>
When they both returned to her home they cooked dinner together and had a wonderful evening.<s>
