Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents.<s>
"Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?"<s>
Jamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him.<s>
"Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey.<s>
When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him.<s>
You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV.<s>
If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."<s>
Jamey was very happy to hear this!<s>
The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept.<s>
It was very noisy inside!<s>
Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first.<s>
"This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said.<s>
"He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."<s>
Jamey thought that Dad was right about that.<s>
The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog.<s>
It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.<s>
"This dog is very noisy Jamey.<s>
He might need a lot of attention from you.<s>
Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"<s>
Jamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy.<s>
Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one.<s>
The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.<s>
"Do you like the brown dog?"<s>
asked Jamey's dad.<s>
"Yes!"<s>
said Jamey.<s>
"Can we get him?"<s>
"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?"<s>
asked Jamey's mom.<s>
"I promise," said Jamey.<s>
"In that case, I guess we have a dog!"<s>
This made Jamey very happy.<s>
