Bobby got a big surprise when he came home from school one day.<s>
He found an angel in his room.<s>
His grandma had always told him angels were real.<s>
Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories.<s>
She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things.<s>
Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true.<s>
He thought angel wings had to be white.<s>
This angel's feathers were many colors.<s>
They were red, blue, and green.<s>
No white ones that he could see.<s>
They looked at each other without speaking.<s>
Then, the angel began to talk.<s>
He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories.<s>
Bobby said he would.<s>
Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly.<s>
The angel told Bobby it could show him.<s>
Bobby would have to beat it at a game.<s>
Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess.<s>
His dad had taught him those.<s>
He was also good at card games.<s>
Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors.<s>
Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won.<s>
Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride.<s>
After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home.<s>
It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone.<s>
Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father.<s>
The angel said it did.<s>
Bobby said he would.<s>
The angel left.<s>
They met a few more times and became good friends.<s>
