It was a rainy day and James wanted to play.<s>
If he went outside to play, he would get wet.<s>
James' mother told him not to get wet because he might catch a cold.<s>
James went out to play, anyway.<s>
Outside, the cool rain kept falling.<s>
There were no other children for James to play with.<s>
The other children were all playing inside, where it was warm and dry.<s>
James found a puddle that had appeared in the mud.<s>
He found a piece of wood and pretended it was a turtle.<s>
He put the wooden turtle in the puddle and watched it float in a circle.<s>
This was not very fun.<s>
After one hour, James went back inside.<s>
When James went inside, he found his mother waiting.<s>
She had her hands on her hips and a serious look on her face.<s>
James was soaking wet!<s>
His mother made him change into dry clothes, and he was not to leave the house for the rest of the day.<s>
The next morning, the sun shone warm and bright, and the birds sang their morning songs.<s>
It was a beautiful day.<s>
When James woke up, he coughed.<s>
Then he sneezed.<s>
His body ached all over.<s>
James had a cold!<s>
James looked out the window and saw the neighbor children playing in their yards.<s>
