Sarah's New Kitty  "Meow."<s>
Sarah eyes opened wide when she heard that sound coming from the basket her mother was holding.<s>
"Mama, what's that sound?<s>
It sounds like a kitty!"<s>
she said to her mother as she tried to reach the basket.<s>
Her mother was holding it up too high for Sarah to reach.<s>
"Sarah," her mother said, "remember I told you that maybe we can get a pet if you could take good care of it?<s>
Well, you're seven years old now and I think you're ready for a special present."<s>
Sarah's mother set the basket on the floor.<s>
Sarah fell on her knees with a big grin on her face.<s>
She slowly lifted the yellow kitty and held its soft little body next to hers.<s>
Sarah gave the kitty a little kiss.<s>
Then she rubbed its head and neck.<s>
Soon it started making gentle sounds.<s>
"Why is the kitty making those funny sounds?"<s>
she asked her mother.<s>
"Oh, that's called purring.<s>
It's the sound kittens make when they're happy," her mother said.<s>
"Can I give it a name?"<s>
Sarah asked.<s>
"Sure.<s>
It's a girl kitty, but choose any name you like."<s>
her mother said.<s>
Sarah thought about it as her mother got two small bowls and placed them on the floor.<s>
Then she put water in one bowl and kitten food in the other bowl.<s>
"Okay, Sarah.<s>
Let's see if the kitty is hungry."<s>
Sarah put the kitty on the floor and it walked over to the food bowl.<s>
It quickly started to eat the food.<s>
Sarah laughed at the kitten and said, "I know.<s>
I'm going to name you Kitty."<s>
