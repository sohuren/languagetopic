All the Grizzly bears felt excitement at the arrival of their new shirts; everyone except Truman, he was a very unhappy bear who didn't like to wear clothing.<s>
He also hated tying his shoes and matching his socks.<s>
These were all things Truman didn't like doing.<s>
So when the Grizzly bear king held a town meeting to pass out all the shirts, Truman stole the microphone and sang a song to express his feelings: "I won't wear those shirts you bear bosses, I won't wear my socks.<s>
I have all the fur I need, don't put me in a shirt box.<s>
I want to scratch the ground with my claws, and feel the wild wind; If you all make me wear, then my darlings as a bear, I think I'll smash you with my paws, and chew off all your skins."<s>
The other bears felt Truman had a point, and so they too chewed up the shirts, shoes, and socks the king gave them; and they chose a king who didn't have a mustache and never, ever wore a shirt and tie.<s>
