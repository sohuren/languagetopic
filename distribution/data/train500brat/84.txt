Ellie and her grandfather went to the beach late in the afternoon.<s>
"Why are we going to the beach, Grandpa?"<s>
Ellie asked.<s>
He smiled a big old smile.<s>
"We're looking for treasure," he said.<s>
He carried two small plastic shovels and a basket.<s>
"What's in the basket?"<s>
she asked.<s>
"Some pie and soda to celebrate when we find our treasure."<s>
He gave his granddaughter a happy laugh.<s>
They picked a spot and started digging.<s>
They found only sand.<s>
They picked another spot by some rocks and found all sorts of small and interesting little stones.<s>
Ellie grinned at their odd shapes and colors.<s>
They dug further away from the water and found an old bottle.<s>
Ellie threw it away into the trash can.<s>
They dug closer to the water and found many sea shells.<s>
Ellie clapped happily at how smooth and nice they felt.<s>
They had much fun digging, but it started to get late.<s>
Her grandpa seemed sad.<s>
"We did not find any treasure after all," he said.<s>
"How about that, grandpa?"<s>
she said, pointing toward the pretty sunset that made the water appear yellow and bright.<s>
He grandfather laughed.<s>
"That is a great treasure after all."<s>
Ellie and her grandfather laughed and hugged.<s>
They ate pie happily and watched the sun set.<s>
