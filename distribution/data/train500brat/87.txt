Billy and Sara are brother and sister.<s>
They went to the beach with their family last July for a week, and had the best time ever!<s>
On Monday, Billy and Sara wanted to build a giant sandcastle.<s>
They invited their new friends Jack and Jane to help build the sandcastle.<s>
Jack and Jane had a house on the beach, so they were really good when it came to building sandcastles.<s>
They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help.<s>
They asked their cousin Joey to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world!<s>
Joey wasn't the friendliest cousin in the world, but to Billy and Sara's surprise, Joey was happy to help build the sandcastle.<s>
Billy, Sara, Jake, Jane and Joey had spent the whole day building the sandcastle, and finally, right before dinner time, they completed it.<s>
The sandcastle was huge!<s>
It had a river around the castle, and even a bridge to cross the river.<s>
It even had a flag at the top, and a wall that went around the castle too!<s>
They were so happy!<s>
\tab  The rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for Billy and Sara.<s>
On Tuesday, they went for ice cream.<s>
Sara's ice cream fell and dripped all the way down to her tummy, but Billy gave her some of his.<s>
On Wednesday, they watched the fireworks at night.<s>
On Thursday, they went swimming all day long, moving like worms in the water.<s>
On Friday, they had to go back home.<s>
They were sad, so they started counting down the days until next year at the beach!<s>
