Billy was a monster.<s>
He was born in Monster Town, where he learned how to be a monster and how to do monster things.<s>
One day Billy was very hungry.<s>
There are no stores in Monster Town, so Billy had to find his own food.<s>
He saw some bugs but he did not want to eat those because bugs are gross and taste bad.<s>
Then he saw a bunny and thought it would be a good thing to eat.<s>
Bunnies are very delicious.<s>
Monsters eat all sorts of things that humans do not eat.<s>
Billy chased the bunny into a field.<s>
Soon he could not find it any more.<s>
Bill was sad.<s>
He was still hungry.<s>
But then he saw a house.<s>
He sneaked towards it and looked inside.<s>
No one was home.<s>
He crawled through an open window and saw a funny looking box.<s>
He opened it and saw many little pebbles inside of all different colors.<s>
He was about to eat them when a small human child appeared out of nowhere and took the box out of his hands.<s>
Silly Billy, Trix are for kids.<s>
