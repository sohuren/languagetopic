Greg enjoys playing with his friends.<s>
On Friday, Greg went outside to play with two of his friends, Peter and Lucy.<s>
They played with a ball for some time, but then they got bored.<s>
Lucy said that she wanted to climb a tree.<s>
Peter thought that they could see if their other friend Robert could play with them.<s>
The three of them went to find Robert.<s>
They saw Robert in front of his house, but he said that he was busy and he could not play with them.<s>
Greg and Peter then thought that Lucy's idea was good.<s>
There was a large tree in the park.<s>
Greg, Peter, and Lucy walked to the park together.<s>
When they got to the park, they were surprised by the size of the tree.<s>
It was much larger than they thought.<s>
At first, Greg was scared to climb the tree.<s>
But Peter and Lucy told him that it would be fun, so he began to climb.<s>
When he had climbed the first few branches, he slipped and fell down.<s>
But he was not hurt.<s>
After that, the three friends thought that it was too dangerous to climb that tree.<s>
So they all went home.<s>
When Greg went home, his mother asked him what happened.<s>
She saw that his shirt was dirty.<s>
Greg explained about the tree.<s>
Then he changed into a different shirt, so that his mother could wash the dirty shirt.<s>
