Sam wanted a phone, so he asked his Mom if he could have one because phones are very expensive.<s>
Sam told his Mom that he could do extra chores for money to buy one.<s>
Sam's Mom told him that a phone is very expensive, much more expensive than the toys he normally buys with his chore money.<s>
But Sam still really wanted a phone.<s>
Sam's Mom came up with an idea and told Sam to pray for one.<s>
Since she could not help him, maybe God could help him.<s>
That night Sam prayed before bed and asked if he could somehow have a phone.<s>
The next day Sam was playing bat and ball with his brother John and sister Lucy.<s>
He saw something shine from the ground.<s>
He found a phone lying there.<s>
He ran and took it to his Mom who checked the phone, and after a quick clean found the phone worked.<s>
She told Sam that someone must have lost the phone and she'll call them to tell them they have found the phone.<s>
Sam sat in the kitchen as Sam's Mom called the number in the phone.<s>
A lady called Pat answered.<s>
After telling the lady the story of Sam and his praying, the lady was so touched that she told Sam's Mom to give the phone to Sam.<s>
