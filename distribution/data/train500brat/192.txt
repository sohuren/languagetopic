John was stuck in the middle of the ocean after his boat crashed and sank.<s>
He was worried about his friend who'd been in the boat with him.<s>
He knew that his friend has his life jacket on, so he tried not to worry too much about him.<s>
John was in a small box that fell out of the boat and kept him out of the water, floating.<s>
John had never been to sea before and one would wonder if he would ever after such a scary thing that happened to him.<s>
He sat in the box for days with no food or water, in and out of sleep.<s>
Three days later he woke up and saw land.<s>
Finally a beach was in sight, John could go home.<s>
