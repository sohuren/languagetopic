Sam was driving.<s>
It was late, it was dark, it was raining, and he was out of cookies.<s>
His squirrel was asleep in the passenger seat, as was his hamster, in the back seat.<s>
He had gone down to the beach for the day, but it had started raining, so he had started driving back.<s>
But he had gotten lost.<s>
Now, he thought he was on the right way back.<s>
His headlights were not very strong.<s>
He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit.<s>
When the thunder came after, his squirrel, Joey, and his hamster, Broey, turned over in their sleep.<s>
Suddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time.<s>
There was a bright light and a crunching sound.<s>
A tree fell in front of the car!<s>
Sam hit the brakes.<s>
The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out.<s>
Sam walked up to the tree.<s>
He tried pushing it.<s>
It was too heavy.<s>
What would he do?<s>
He heard the car door open and shut behind him.<s>
It was Joey!<s>
And Broey!<s>
Together, the three of them pushed.<s>
Joey and Broey were small, but strong.<s>
And together, they moved the tree.<s>
They got back in the car.<s>
Sam was wet, and turned on the heater.<s>
He was tired, but he knew he would get home now - thanks to his animal friends.<s>
