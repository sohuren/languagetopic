Many, many years back, in a place full of magic, there lived a man and a woman who were married.<s>
The man and woman did not love one another or anything else.<s>
The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood.<s>
One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost.<s>
After days and days he grew hungry and weak.<s>
When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him.<s>
The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.<s>
The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, "I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world."<s>
Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once.<s>
The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood.<s>
The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise.<s>
In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved.<s>
One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise.<s>
The man was very sad to lose his daughter.<s>
But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard.<s>
The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave.<s>
Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter.<s>
Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him.<s>
And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad.<s>
But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful.<s>
"If you marry me I can let you out."<s>
"There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks.<s>
I am very happy here in my cave."<s>
The girl said.<s>
The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyes  He blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness.<s>
Still the girl said no.<s>
The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out."<s>
The wizard became angry and steam poured from his mouth  "There is a lovely stream of water that comes in through the rocks.<s>
I am very happy here in my cave."<s>
The girl said.<s>
The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears  He blocked out the water so the girl lived only in dry sand.<s>
Still the girl said no.<s>
The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out."<s>
Again, the girl only said "There is a soft wind that comes in through the rocks.<s>
I am very happy here in my cave."<s>
The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears and fire came out of his eyes  So the Wizard blocked out the wind and left the girl in a hot cave with no air.<s>
But the girl would still not marry him.<s>
The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up.<s>
The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone.<s>
Instead she found a handsome prince.<s>
"I thank you my lady," he said, "for saving me from the evil wizard.<s>
In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy."<s>
The girl said yes.<s>
In time they came to love one another and got married and lived happy together.<s>
