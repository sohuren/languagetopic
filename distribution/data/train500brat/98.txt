Ralph was an alligator that loved to splash around in the water.<s>
Ralph had three brothers, named Henry, Larry, and Thomas.<s>
But none of Ralph's three brothers liked to play in the water.<s>
They were very mean brothers, but the meanest of them all was Henry.<s>
Henry would always chase Ralph around the lake and try to beat him up when he was splashing around.<s>
Then on his birthday, Ralph thought of a great idea.<s>
His idea was to stop Henry from beating him by using a trick.<s>
He would trick Henry into thinking one side of the lake was scary.<s>
Ralph dressed up in a spooky costume and waited for Henry to swim over to the side of the lake.<s>
Then when Henry came over, Ralph started making spooky sounds and scared Henry back to the other side of the lake.<s>
Henry was so scared he never came to the other side of the lake again and Ralph was free to splash around in peace.<s>
