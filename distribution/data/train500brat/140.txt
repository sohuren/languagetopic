Kerry was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard.<s>
He put down his toy and went over to look.<s>
He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.<s>
Carefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass.<s>
He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water.<s>
He wanted to help the frog.<s>
He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand.<s>
He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.<s>
It took him some time to find the frog again.<s>
It seemed to be moving slower than it had before.<s>
He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water.<s>
He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house.<s>
It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood.<s>
Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water.<s>
The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked.<s>
Finally, he reached the creek.<s>
He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.<s>
