One day my dad was walking home and he had a big ice-cream cone.<s>
He had chocolate and vanilla and strawberry ice-cream on top of each other.<s>
He was moving his head back and forward to some music that he was playing when a spider dropped on his ice-cream for a little bite.<s>
My dad saw right away that a spider was on it and he brushed the spider off.<s>
After the spider was put on the floor, a fly flew into his ice-cream, right where the spider had been!<s>
Oh how terrible!<s>
My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too!<s>
My dad dropped his cone, ran away, and bought a yoghurt instead.<s>
He thought about buying a dingdong, but since dinner time was so close and he had such a big lunch, he thought a yoghurt would be better.<s>
It's a much safer and better dessert.<s>
