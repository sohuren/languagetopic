Elizabeth jumped right out of bed on Saturday morning.<s>
Today was the day her father was going to take her and her sister, Rebecca, to the zoo.<s>
Her mother made them biscuits and eggs for breakfast.<s>
The two girls were too excited to sit still.<s>
They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.<s>
The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.<s>
He was going to feed the penguins.<s>
The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.<s>
Next, the girls ran to where the pandas live.<s>
The pandas were playing by rolling down the hill.<s>
After watching the pandas, the girls and their father moved to where the lions were.<s>
One lion was asleep on his back but the others were in a circle eating some meat.<s>
It did not look tasty.<s>
The girls didn't want to watch this any more so they walked to where the zebras were eating grass.<s>
Rebecca thought it would be fun to ride one like a horse.<s>
