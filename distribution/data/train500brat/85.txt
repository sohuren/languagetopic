Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.<s>
They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house.<s>
They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime.<s>
One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek.<s>
They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf.<s>
Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot.<s>
Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide.<s>
In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound!<s>
Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy!<s>
The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone.<s>
They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek.<s>
As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy.<s>
The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face.<s>
The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill.<s>
The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!<s>
