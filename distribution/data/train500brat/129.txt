This story takes place in a faraway land.<s>
One day, in this magical kingdom a happy little kitten, named Lucy, was walking down the road.<s>
As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.<s>
The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.<s>
The frog said, "Oh, yes.<s>
My name is Sammy.<s>
I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.<s>
I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock."<s>
The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.<s>
She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.<s>
When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.<s>
The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.<s>
As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.<s>
In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.<s>
