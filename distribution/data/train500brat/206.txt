Once there was a boy named Fritz who loved to draw.<s>
He drew everything.<s>
In the morning, he drew a picture of his cereal with milk.<s>
His papa said, "Don't draw your cereal.<s>
Eat it!"<s>
After school, Fritz drew a picture of his bicycle.<s>
His uncle said, "Don't draw your bicycle.<s>
Ride it!"<s>
At nighttime, after he finished washing his face, he drew a picture of the toothpaste on the sink.<s>
His mama said, "Don't draw the toothpaste.<s>
Brush your teeth!"<s>
One day Fritz got a splinter in his foot.<s>
It hurt.<s>
He wanted to take the splinter out.<s>
But first, he drew a picture of his foot with the splinter in it.<s>
He said, "Now I can remember what my foot looks like with a splinter in it."<s>
Then he took the splinter out all by himself.<s>
He told his friend Stephen that he took the splinter out all by himself.<s>
Stephen did not believe him.<s>
Fritz showed him the picture.<s>
Then Stephen believed him.<s>
