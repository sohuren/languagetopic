Jill ran upstairs as soon as she got home from school.<s>
Today she was a sad and angry girl.<s>
Her teacher had given her a lot of homework.<s>
Jill always thought homework wasn't fair.<s>
But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy.<s>
The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun.<s>
When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed.<s>
Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly.<s>
While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it.<s>
Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better.<s>
Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan.<s>
She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth.<s>
As she chewed, she opened her toy chest.<s>
Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys.<s>
Things were looking up!<s>
Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework.<s>
Nothing would get in the way of her plan.<s>
It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work.<s>
When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks.<s>
She told it, "Mister Sparks, do my homework!"<s>
Then Jill had to go eat dinner.<s>
After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle.<s>
It was so much fun!<s>
But Jill got some bad news before going to bed.<s>
Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!<s>
