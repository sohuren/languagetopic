Sally was looking through her closet for some clothes to wear to the school dance tomorrow night.<s>
She had a lot of clothes to look through, but she needed something perfect for the dance, since she would be seen by a lot of other people, and she wanted to stand out from the rest of the girls.<s>
There would be a lot of boys there, too.<s>
If she looked as nice as she imagined she could, she would have a lot of boys asking her to dance.<s>
And she didn't want to dance alone, because that would make her feel sad.<s>
But she had to hurry, since it was getting late, and she had to sleep soon.<s>
She was so excited, that she barely touched her baked potato she had during suppertime.<s>
She also had chicken, some green beans, and corn on the cob.<s>
She came down to four choices for what she could wear to the dance.<s>
a pink dress, a green dress, a red dress, and a yellow dress.<s>
She tried on each one and looked at herself in the mirror to see how she looked.<s>
She chose the yellow dress, because it was the prettiest.<s>
After making her choice, she changed into her pajamas and got in bed.<s>
She turned the light out and fell asleep.<s>
She dreamed about the fun she would have at the dance.<s>
Sally smiled as she slept.<s>
