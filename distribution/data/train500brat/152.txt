Jim wanted to go eat some pizza.<s>
He was a giant.<s>
He had eaten a hot dog and some carrots earlier that day, but it had been a long time.<s>
He was very hungry after a hard day of playing with his kitty.<s>
But Jim had a problem, he did know where he was.<s>
While playing with his kitten, he had left his yard and wandered into the deep woods that were near his house.<s>
It was getting dark outside, and Jim the giant was scared.<s>
He was also hungry.<s>
It had been a long time since Jim had eaten.<s>
Also, it was becoming cold, and Jim had left his jacket on the ground.<s>
There was some joy from the fact that he had his kitty.<s>
His name was Bob, and was riding around on his shoulder.<s>
Still, Jim needed to find his way out of the woods fast.<s>
It was at this time that Jim remembered that he had a flashlight in his pocket.<s>
With his flashlight, Jim could see the woods, and spot his house off in this distance.<s>
He ran home fast.<s>
Once he was home, Jim put down his kitty, and ordered a pizza.<s>
He was safe.<s>
He called his friends Steve and Adam to tell them about his big adventure, and sat down to play with his kitty Bob.<s>
