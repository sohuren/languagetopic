June volunteered to drive her friends Ben, Sasha, and Bruce.<s>
The teenagers piled into the red car and drove to the mall.<s>
When they arrived, Ben and Sasha wanted to go to the sporting goods store.<s>
However, Bruce and June wanted to go watch a movie directed by Miranda July.<s>
They split up and said they would meet up at the food area later.<s>
Three hours later, the friends got back together.<s>
Ben and Sasha wanted to leave, so they went back out to the parking lot and got in the car.<s>
When June backed out of the parking spot, she scraped the car next to her.<s>
Sasha said it was okay, but Bruce said June needed to leave a note for the driver of the other car.<s>
Just then, the other driver appeared.<s>
They called the police to get an accident report.<s>
When the police arrived, they put Ben and Sasha in handcuffs because they had been stealing.<s>
