One day, Harry bought a pet hamster name Tom.<s>
Tom was round and furry and had a funny smell.<s>
Harry loved it when Tom would climb up his arm and into his shirt sleeve.<s>
Every day before bed Harry would put Tom into his cage and every morning Harry would take Tom out of his cage and carry him around in his front shirt pocket during the day.<s>
Harry would carry Tom everywhere he went.<s>
Harry's favorite thing to do was to watch Tom run around in his exercise wheel.<s>

He looked everywhere for Tom, wondering where he could have disappeared to.<s>
Harry called his friends John, Rodney, and Bruno to ask if they knew where Tom was.<s>
