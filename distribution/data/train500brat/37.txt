On Sunday, our family went for a picnic.<s>
Mom, dad, Alice, Sissy (our dog), and I got in the van and drove to the park.<s>
Alice and I played fetch with Sissy.<s>
Dad fired up the grill and made some hamburgers.<s>
Mom made some salad.<s>
Mom asked me to spread the picnic cloth.<s>
Sissy wanted to help me too.<s>
Once the burgers were ready, we sat down to eat.<s>
They were delicious, I ate two!<s>
Alice only ate one hamburger.<s>
I didn't like the salad because I don't like carrots.<s>
Mom says they're good for me.<s>
Sissy doesn't like carrots either.<s>
After lunch, I played with dad and Alice played with mom and Sissy.<s>
Dad and I were flying a kite.<s>
Alice and mom played with flowers.<s>
Then we packed up the van and went home.<s>
I fell asleep on the way home.<s>
Sunday was a lot of fun.<s>
I want to do it again!<s>
