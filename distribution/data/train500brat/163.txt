Nick was so happy to finally meet his cousin.<s>
Just this morning he found out what a cousin is.<s>
A cousin is somebody who has the same grandmother and grandfather as you.<s>
He didn't even know he had a cousin and now they were going to play together.<s>
This was going to be a great day.<s>
Right after he ate lunch and had a quick piece of candy for snack he pulled out the letter that his cousin Chris wrote to him.<s>
He read it over and over again.<s>
They liked so many of the same things, like riding bikes and playing games.<s>
It was only twelve o'clock and Nick did not know if he would make it until Chris got here.<s>
He had two more hours to go.<s>
Nick fell asleep as he was reading a book and woke up to the sound of a car outside.<s>
It must be them!<s>
He jumped up and ran downstairs and right out the door to the car.<s>
That's when he saw Chris through the car window.<s>
Nick was really surprised.<s>
Chris had a ponytail!<s>
Chris was a girl!<s>
It turned out that Nick still really liked his cousin Chris, even if she was a girl.<s>
