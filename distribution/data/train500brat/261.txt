Jim was looking up at the sky when he saw it.<s>
He saw a bright light.<s>
It got brighter and brighter.<s>
But after a few seconds, it started getting less bright.<s>
It took him a second to know for sure, but he knew he had seen a shooting star!<s>
This wasn't the first time that Jim had seen something strange in the sky.<s>
It was last year, when he was driving home from work at night.<s>
He saw another light in the sky that night, but it wasn't anything like this one.<s>
The one he saw last year didn't get brighter.<s>
The one he saw last year didn't get less bright.<s>
The one he saw last year was round, and Jim was sure that it was a space ship.<s>
When Jim saw the shooting star tonight, he was even more sure of what he saw last year.<s>
Some people said that the space ship was really a shooting star.<s>
But now that he had seen a real shooting star, he knew for sure that this one was different.<s>
Jim wondered what planet the space ship had come from.<s>
