Once upon a time, a lion, a tiger, a bear, and a duck finished school.<s>
So, they moved out of their parents' houses and set out to get jobs.<s>
The lion flew on a red airplane.<s>
The tiger rode an orange train.<s>
The bear rode a yellow bus.<s>
And the duck sailed on a blue boat.<s>
The train went to Ohio.<s>
The bus went to Iowa.<s>
The boat sailed to Hawaii.<s>
And the airplane flew to Utah.<s>
The lion wanted to be a fireman.<s>
The tiger wanted to be a nurse.<s>
The bear wanted to be a doctor.<s>
And the duck wanted to be President.<s>
But none of them could find the job they wanted.<s>
So, they all became artists instead.<s>
The lion bought a crayon to draw with.<s>
The tiger bought a pen.<s>
The bear bought a pencil.<s>
And the duck bought a paintbrush.<s>
The crayon was red.<s>
The pen was yellow.<s>
The pencil was green.<s>
And the paintbrush was blue.<s>
