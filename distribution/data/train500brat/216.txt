I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel.<s>
The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides.<s>
My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake.<s>
The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it.<s>
There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake.<s>
Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy.<s>
One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot.<s>
That cut hurt and made me sad.<s>
The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut.<s>
Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals.<s>
There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park.<s>
Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers.<s>
Their favorite thing to eat is ham.<s>
After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream.<s>
Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me.<s>
Christopher also likes feeding the animals.<s>
His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel.<s>
