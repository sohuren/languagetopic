Once upon a time, there was an old man named John.<s>
John loved to eat peaches.<s>
In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches.<s>
John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner.<s>
John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches.<s>
One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit.<s>
They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit.<s>
After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted.<s>
They picked the peach and brought it home.<s>
They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did.<s>
John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm.<s>
They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time.<s>
Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years.<s>
One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm.<s>
Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed.<s>
The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it.<s>
John and Rick started shouting for joy.<s>
