The chipmunks were busy getting ready for the winter.<s>
Little Chip had never seen everyone so busy.<s>
Chipmunks were running this way and that way.<s>
Even his Granddaddy was helping out, stuffing melons up into the holes in the tree.<s>
Aunt Chippa was clapping at everyone to hurry them up.<s>
Little Chip wasn't sure what they were all doing.<s>
His mom had told him, "Getting ready for winter" but Little Chip didn't know what that meant.<s>
He sat on the seesaw trying to guess.<s>
He knew that people were gathering things.<s>
Now that he thought about it, they were gathering food!<s>
Little Chip thought for a second...could they be gathering food for a party?<s>
That couldn't be it, everyone was gathering so much food that not every chipmunk in the town could come close to eating all the food for a single party.<s>
Little Chip looked at his big toe and thought.<s>
He saw another chipmunk digging in the ground and stuffing more food there.<s>
Was the guy trying to plant seeds to grow?<s>
Seeds wouldn't grow in the winter, it's too cold!<s>
Little Chip sat up and knew why everyone was so busy!<s>
Winter is coming!<s>
