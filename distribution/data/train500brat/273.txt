One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden.<s>
I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants.<s>
My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants.<s>
I watered the garden daily with a watering can.<s>
When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back.<s>
About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day.<s>
I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready.<s>
Sometimes I ate them right off the vine.<s>
One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over.<s>
Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week.<s>
I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor.<s>
I gave some to my parents to take to their friends.<s>
Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood.<s>
