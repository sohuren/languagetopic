Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard.<s>
She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present.<s>
She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen.<s>
She knew where the best flowers were in her yard.<s>
She got a lot of different sized flowers.<s>
The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle.<s>
After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string.<s>
After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot.<s>
She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them.<s>
Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher.<s>
Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited!<s>
Kelly gave her mother the flowers.<s>
Her mother's favorite was the red one.<s>
