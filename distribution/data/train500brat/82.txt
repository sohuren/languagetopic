There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.<s>
The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.<s>
Each brother was one year in age.<s>
The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.<s>
Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.<s>
Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks.<s>
Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball.<s>
Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.<s>
One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.<s>
For this trick he would need three things.<s>
First, he needed four cups each a different color.<s>
The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.<s>
He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.<s>
He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.<s>
He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.<s>
Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.<s>
Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.<s>
To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.<s>
Each brother got to look under a cup.<s>
After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.<s>
Just a single green ball inside the green cup!<s>
How did you do that they yelled!<s>
A magician never gives up his secrets.<s>
