While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street.<s>
"Can we get ice cream, Nana?"<s>
asked Tina.<s>
"Sure we can!"<s>
I answered.<s>
As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face.<s>
"Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!"<s>
Laughing at what was said, I answered, "If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!"<s>
Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda.<s>
"Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?"<s>
she asked.<s>
"If that is what you want, you sure can!"<s>
I answered.<s>
We got our food and headed to the picnic table.<s>
On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class.<s>
"Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?"<s>
"Let's go!"<s>
We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly.<s>
She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch.<s>
"That is okay", she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".<s>
Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home.<s>
So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day.<s>
We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.<s>
