It was one week before Halloween and Thomas still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating.<s>
Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw.<s>
Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better.<s>
His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real.<s>
Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items.<s>
He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth.<s>
After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished.<s>
When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was.<s>
He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him.<s>
The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating.<s>
They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby.<s>
They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf.<s>
When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing.<s>
His costume was so real that it had tricked them both.<s>
"Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.<s>
