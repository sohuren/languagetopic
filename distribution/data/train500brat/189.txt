Jim wanted to make a fun meal one day.<s>
After thinking about it for a long time, he chose to make a chicken dish.<s>
Jim made a trip to the store to collect all of the different things he would need to make this meal.<s>
He drove his blue truck to the store.<s>
On the way he passed a green car, a red van, and a yellow bus.<s>
When he got to the store, he met his friends Bob & Mark.<s>
He asked if they had seen his friend Joe, but they said no.<s>
At the store, Jim bought two pieces of chicken, tomato sauce, cheese, and bread.<s>
He drove back to the house, but he saw that something was missing.<s>
He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it.<s>
He drove back to the store, apologized to the clerk, and grabbed his bag with the bread inside.<s>
When he got home, he began to get the food ready.<s>
It took him an hour to get the chicken ready to cook and the oven heated up.<s>
After that, it took him another hour to cook the food.<s>
He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive.<s>
When they finally arrived, everyone told Jim how wonderful the food tasted, and everyone at the table asked for seconds.<s>
Jim smiled, glad that everyone loved this meal that he had worked so hard to make.<s>
