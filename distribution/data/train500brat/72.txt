One hot afternoon in the summertime a family and their dog were getting ready to have a dinnertime picnic in the park.<s>
The dishes in the picnic included peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, watermelons, potato salad, and chocolate cookies.<s>
When they got to the park the father, George, was looking for a good place to have the picnic.<s>
While they were walking they bumped into their neighbors, Robert and Natalie, and their twins, Anson and Anne and their dog Emile.<s>
Robert explained that it was the twins' birthday and they were celebrating by going out for a walk.<s>
They said goodbye and kept looking for a picnic spot.<s>
He chose a nice spot under a tree that would keep the family cool.<s>
While setting up the picnic, the mother, Barbara, told the son, Ralph to go play with their dog, Scout, to pass some time until it was time for dinner.<s>
Ralph found a stick and began to play fetch with Scout down the hill.<s>
Some time passed and Ralph began to return to the picnic with Scout.<s>
Along the way back he picked a flower to give to his mom because it was Mother's day.<s>
When he arrived he gave the flower to his mom and she said, "Thank you so much, Ralph!"<s>
His mother poured him a cool and tasty glass of lemonade.<s>
It tasted extra good because it was so hot outside!<s>
Ralph sat down and enjoyed the picnic with his family under the large tree.<s>
