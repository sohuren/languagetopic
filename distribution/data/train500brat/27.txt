The booger on the balloon sailed far and wide.<s>
The wind pushed it.<s>
The wind pulled it.<s>
The booger on the balloon sailed into a house.<s>
In the house was a table.<s>
On the table was an orange.<s>
Next to the orange was some chocolate.<s>
Under the table was a crayon.<s>
Under the crayon was a seed.<s>
The booger on the balloon flew out of the house.<s>
Outside, there was snow.<s>
A dog went woof.<s>
A cat went meow.<s>
But the booger on the balloon did not hear them.<s>
The booger on the balloon had no ears!<s>
The wind blew the booger on the balloon far away, until one day...  ...POP!<s>
The booger on the balloon fell on top of an alligator, never to be seen again.<s>
