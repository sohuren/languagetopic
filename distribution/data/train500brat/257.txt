Kendra and Quinton travel to and from school every day.<s>
Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop.<s>
Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them.<s>
Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day.<s>
They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together.<s>
Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner.<s>
She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime.<s>
One morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found.<s>
Kendra went up to the door and knocked.<s>
She waited and waited and yet no one answered.<s>
She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird.<s>
She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found.<s>
Kendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time.<s>
The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning.<s>
She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay.<s>
Kendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning.<s>
The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.<s>
