"Be home by dinnertime", Eric's mother said as he left for school that morning.<s>
Eric was excited.<s>
Today was show and tell, and he planned to do his magic tricks for the whole class.<s>
Once he got to school, he couldn't wait until it was his turn.<s>
First up was Angie, who brought her pet lizard.<s>
It could change colors to match whatever it was sitting on.<s>
The second to be called was John, who showed the class a flower he had grown from seeds.<s>
Finally Eric's name was called.<s>
He went to the front of the class.<s>
"For my first trick" he said, "I'll pull a hamster out of a hat".<s>
He had borrowed his sister Candice's pet hamster in order to do his trick.<s>
He showed the class his that the hat was empty, then he reached inside, into the secret space where the hamster was hidden.<s>
The hamster was gone.<s>
He heard a scream.<s>
Two girls were standing on their chairs, and the hamster was crawling toward the back of the class.<s>
The teacher made him stay after school as punishment, but at least he made it home by dinnertime.<s>
