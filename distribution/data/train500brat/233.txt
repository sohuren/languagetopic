William was sitting in his room working on his homework.<s>
It was something he did since he went to kindergarten.<s>
William could see outside from where he was sitting.<s>
He had a view of a beautiful sunset this time of year.<s>
It was late spring, and he sometimes found his mind wandering as he looked outside, and hated losing time like that.<s>
The sooner he finished his homework, the sooner he could go to his friend Jacob's house, where he was spending the night.<s>
William loved sleepovers with Jacob.<s>
They would do fun stuff like tell jokes, watch TV, play board games, and eat lots of junk food.<s>
Jacob also had a cool RC car that William liked to play with.<s>
But William's parents wouldn't allow him to go to Jacob's house until he finished his homework first.<s>
