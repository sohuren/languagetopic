Jessica went to sit in her rocking chair.<s>
Today was her birthday and she was turning 80.<s>
Her granddaughter Annie was coming over in the afternoon and Jessica was very excited to see her.<s>
Her daughter Melanie and Melanie's husband Josh were coming as well.<s>
Jessica had a lot to do before they got here, but she was very tired.<s>
After taking a nap for half an hour Jessica got up and walked to the drier.<s>
She moved the dry clothes into a basket.<s>
Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier.<s>
She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room.<s>
She also needed to feed her duck.<s>
The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor.<s>
Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl.<s>
After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing.<s>
She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say "Happy birthday grandma!"<s>
Annie said they would be over very soon.<s>
Jessica smiled because she loved her family more than anything.<s>
She was very excited.<s>
She sat back on her rocking chair and waited until her family arrived.<s>
