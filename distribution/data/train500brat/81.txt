Alex was right next to his close friend when he heard a strange noise.<s>
He was afraid of this noise so he built a shield.<s>
From behind the shield, Alex had to shout, "Who is there?"<s>
Then he saw an animal that had a green stripe across its back.<s>
Alex was scared.<s>
Then the animal stepped into a plate filled with frosting and the animal slipped and fell on the ground.<s>
Alex had to be quiet so he could get to the out and to the playground without the animal hearing him.<s>
After he was far enough away, Alex started to run very fast.<s>
He ran and ran until he finally made it to the playground where he hid for the rest of the day in the sand box.<s>
When he felt safe he called his mother and had her pick him up and get away.<s>
When his mom got there, Alex said, "Thank you for coming to get me mom, I was so scared."<s>
His mom told him, "You are very welcome Alex. I'm here whenever you need me."<s>
