Johnny walked toward the time machine.<s>
His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend.<s>
He had also asked Johnny not to touch it.<s>
But it was a time machine.<s>
Johnny had to see it.<s>
The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped.<s>
It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge.<s>
Johnny took a deep breath and stepped inside.<s>
Just a peek, he thought.<s>
There were three buttons inside.<s>
One said "past," and one said "present."<s>
Another said "space."<s>
Johnny looked at the buttons.<s>
He looked at the buttons some more.<s>
He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him.<s>
He pushed the button that said "past."<s>
There was a bright light!<s>
And bam!<s>
Johnny stepped out of the machine.<s>
It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees.<s>
The air was warm.<s>
The dirt below was muddy.<s>
He took a deep breath.<s>
"So this is the past," Johnny said.<s>
Just then he heard a bump.<s>
And another one.<s>
The ground shook.<s>
The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder.<s>
A tree fell.<s>
Johnny heard a roar.<s>
Two more trees fell.<s>
Suddenly, Johnny saw it: A Tyrannosaurus Rex!<s>
Johnny was so scared he couldn't breathe.<s>
The T. Rex looked up, and left, and right.<s>
He sniffed the air and leaned down.<s>
He didn't seem to see Johnny.<s>
Then Johnny sneezed.<s>
And the T. Rex started walking towards him.<s>
Faster and faster.<s>
Bump.<s>
Bump bump.<s>
Bumpbumpbumpbump until he was running.<s>
Johnny jumped back into the time machine and pressed "present."<s>
There was a bright light and Johnny was back home.<s>
He took a deep breath.<s>
He was home.<s>
"Phew," he said.<s>
Next time, he would listen to his adult neighbor, he thought.<s>
