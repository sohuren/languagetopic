Once upon a time there were four children.<s>
Each of the children had a favorite color.<s>
John's favorite color was blue.<s>
Jack's favorite color was red.<s>
Jenny's favorite color was purple and Alice's favorite color was yellow.<s>
They walked along the road one day and stopped to pick flowers for their mother.<s>
Jack picked a handful of red flowers.<s>
"Mom is going to love these!"<s>
he said.<s>
Jenny picked a handful of purple flowers.<s>
"These are perfect for mother," She thought.<s>
Alice picked two handfuls of yellow flowers.<s>
"Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen," she said.<s>
John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers.<s>
He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers.<s>
He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers.<s>
He was very sad.<s>
They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother.<s>
John walked very slowly and hung his head because he didn't have any flowers to give his mother.<s>
As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence.<s>
He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters.<s>
When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked.<s>
She thanked them and put them on her kitchen table.<s>
"I have the most thoughtful children in the world," She said.<s>
