Randy was a boy who loved to eat spaghetti.<s>
One day he met a girl named Hilda.<s>
People said that Hilda made the best spaghetti in the world.<s>
So Randy wanted to try some of Hilda's spaghetti.<s>
He asked Hilda, "Hilda, would you make me some spaghetti please?"<s>
Hilda said, "Sure!<s>
Just come to my house tomorrow!"<s>
So the next day Randy went to Hilda's house, sat down in the dining room, and waited.<s>
Then Hilda came out with a big plate of spaghetti with spinach soup.<s>
The only problem was that the spaghetti was bright blue.<s>
Randy said, "This spaghetti is blue!<s>
The soup is blue also!<s>
I hate the color blue and I won't eat any blue food!"<s>
This made Hilda sad, and she started to cry.<s>
This made Randy feel bad so he said, "It's okay, Hilda.<s>
Don't cry.<s>
I'll let you try again."<s>
So Hilda made a new plate of spaghetti for Randy.<s>
This time it wasn't blue and came with a salad with cheese.<s>
Randy said, "That's much better!"<s>
Then he started to eat.<s>
Suddenly Randy spit out all the spaghetti because there was a big nasty bug in it.<s>
This made Randy very angry and he threw all the spaghetti on the floor.<s>
Hilda said, "I'm so sorry, I don't know how that got there!"<s>
Randy calmed down and said, "I'm sorry too.<s>
Let's forget the spaghetti.<s>
I can eat the salad instead."<s>
When Randy finished the salad, Hilda asked if Randy wanted dessert.<s>
Randy said "no" because he was too full.<s>
