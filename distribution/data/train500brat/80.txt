Once there was a granddaddy named Tom who hadn't seen his daughter Rachel in many years.<s>
Rachel had a daughter of her own named Melissa, but she and Tom had had a fight before Melissa was born.<s>
Because of that, Tom had never met Melissa.<s>
Tom's wife Marge had died many years before, so he lived alone.<s>
He liked living alone, but he missed Rachel.<s>
Tom spent most of his time working in his garden.<s>
He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes.<s>
He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them.<s>
He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant.<s>
One day Tom got a call on his phone.<s>
He picked it up and asked who it was.<s>
The voice on the other end of the line said, "It's me, Rachel."<s>
Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone.<s>
He said, "Rachel, is it really you?<s>
I can't believe it."<s>
Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight.<s>
Tom was so happy.<s>
They were going to meet the next weekend.<s>
Even before he hung up, Tom could imagine himself hugging his daughter.<s>
He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.<s>
