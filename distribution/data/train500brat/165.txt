Bobby was a little barn mouse and loved to sleep on a blanket.<s>
Every day in the morning, Bobby would wake up and fold his little blue blanket that he slept on.<s>

Bobby loved this blanket more than any other thing he had.<s>
Bobby had a lot of neat stuff.<s>
He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring.<s>
He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon.<s>
Bobby's uncle Arthur would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that Bobby didn't get in any trouble.<s>
Bobby had to be careful that people didn't see him, because the people didn't like mice.<s>
Bobby didn't understand, because people liked other animals, but would scream if they saw a mouse.<s>
They didn't scream if they saw a dog, cat or chicken.<s>
