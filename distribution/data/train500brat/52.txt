Bob was flying a toy plane in his yard.<s>
He was having a great time!<s>
Bob had a dog and a cat that were also playing in the yard.<s>
He was also singing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."<s>
Bob flew his toy plane too high.<s>
It landed on the roof of his house.<s>
Bob asked his dad to get it.<s>
Bob's dad said he had to borrow a ladder from next door.<s>
Bob's dad took a walk next door.<s>
On the way, Bob's dad waited for a duck to cross the road.<s>
Finally, Bob's dad went next door and asked his neighbor, Frank, for a ladder.<s>
Frank gave the ladder to Bob's dad.<s>
Frank also gave Bob's dad a toy car, a toy train, a toy boat, and a coloring book that Bob could play with in case he couldn't get the plane.<s>
Bob's dad walked back to the house.<s>
Bob's dad climbed the ladder and took the plane from the roof.<s>
Bob laughed and flew the plane again.<s>
Afterward, they wanted to go to the beach.<s>
Bob wanted to bring his bicycle.<s>
Bob's dad wanted to bring a towel and beach ball.<s>
They made a big sand castle.<s>
They saw a seagull walking on the sand.<s>
It was getting late, so they went home and turned on the TV for a little bit.<s>
They then went to bed, looking forward to another day of fun tomorrow!<s>
