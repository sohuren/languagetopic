Tom had a pet.<s>
Tom loved his pet and would always laugh at the funny thing he did when facing his chin.<s>
The pet was a dog.<s>
Tom would blow in the dog's ear in order to make him mad.<s>
One day Tom wanted to give the dog a treat but he wouldn't eat it.<s>
Tom got very upset and confused and said, "I think my dog is going to die."<s>
So Tom threw his dog a party in the sand to make his dog happy and have a great life.<s>
At the party they only listened to hit songs.<s>
Tom let his dog eat anything he wanted, even a dingdong.<s>
Tom invited the dog's favorite friend, his nana.<s>
