My dad runs the Blue Street Zoo.<s>
Everyone calls him the Zoo King.<s>
That means Mom is the Zoo Queen.<s>
And that means that I'm the Zoo Prince!<s>
Being a prince is very special.<s>
I spend every morning walking around to see the zoo.<s>
It's better than any animal book.<s>
I say hello to the lions.<s>
I say woof at all of the wolves.<s>
I make faces to the penguins.<s>
Once I even gave a morning kiss to a bear!<s>
My favorite animal is the piggy.<s>
I named him Samson.<s>
He likes to eat mustard, so I toss some mustard jars into his cage every morning.<s>
I don't know why that piggy likes mustard so much.<s>
Sometimes I walk around with the Zoo King and Zoo Queen.<s>
Then we say hello to the animals together!<s>
I really like those days.<s>
Everybody who works at the Zoo says hello to us when we walk by.<s>
At lunchtime, we all go to the Zoo restaurant and eat pork chops.<s>
I hope Samson doesn't get mad about that!<s>
