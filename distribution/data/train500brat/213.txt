Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.<s>
They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.<s>
If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.<s>
If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.<s>
All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!<s>
The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.<s>
They drove by their school on the way.<s>
The boys were glad to be out for the summer.<s>
On the road, the boys played a game.<s>
Whoever counted the most big trucks would be the winner.<s>
James counted one hundred and five trucks.<s>
This was more than Sam or Evan counted.<s>
Evan pointed out the window at a man dressed all in black riding a black motorcycle.<s>
The man had a long beard.<s>
When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned.<s>
The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.<s>
Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.<s>
He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.<s>
Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.<s>
He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug.<s>
