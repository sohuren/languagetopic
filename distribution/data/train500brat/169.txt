Joe got a new bicycle as a gift from one of his friends.<s>
He wanted to ride it so he looked outside his window to check the weather.<s>
There was lots of daylight and it was bright and sunny.<s>
The sky was clear and there was only a little bit of wind.<s>
He was excited that the weather was good because it meant that he can go and ride his bicycle.<s>
He took his bicycle down the stairway and told his parents that he wanted to go ride his bicycle for a little bit.<s>
After his parents said OK, he put on his helmet and went outside with his bicycle to ride it around the block.<s>
It was very fun and Joe had a great time riding his bicycle.<s>
While he was riding, he saw many interesting things like some insects that would fly around and some pets that were in peoples' backyards.<s>
He also saw some flowers growing in peoples' yards.<s>
He got back home from riding his bicycle and told his parents he had a great time.<s>
