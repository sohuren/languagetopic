On a Monday, a mother was in the kitchen cooking ham for the family.<s>
She was in quite the hurry because she had to pick the kids up from school.<s>
Without knowing, she stuck a spoon in the ham and put the ham in the oven.<s>
She wasn't paying attention because of being in a hurry and also because the dog was playing with a ball.<s>
The ball flew past her head as she had finished putting the ham in the oven.<s>
She yelled at the dog and made him play with the ball outside.<s>
She saw clouds in the sky as she let the dog out.<s>
Seeing that the clouds were so pretty that she wanted to take a picture of them.<s>
She got her camera and took a few pictures as the dog played happily in the yard.<s>
