A guy with brown hair was named Josh.<s>
His daughter was Maggie and her favorite activity was riding her yellow bike.<s>
Sometimes she would put a card in the spokes of the wheel.<s>
This made her bike sound much faster than it was going.<s>
Once when she was riding down a hill, she went too fast and hit a trashcan.<s>
Other than having a bad smell, she was ok but was afraid to tell her father what had happened.<s>
So she told a lie.<s>
