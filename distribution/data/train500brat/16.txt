Dave and John were playing catch in the living room.<s>
Rose told them that was dumb, but she did not stop them.<s>
She kept writing in her notebook.<s>
If they wanted to get in trouble, then they could.<s>
It was not her responsibility.<s>
Dave told John to go long.<s>
Dave did not have good aim and missed John's hands when he threw the ball.<s>
Instead he hit the lamp and knocked it over.<s>
He was glad he did not hit the dishes.<s>
Nor did he hit the cat.<s>
John was not glad that he hit the lamp, but was glad that the lamp was not broken.<s>
When John's dad came home, he was very happy that John came clean about the lamp even when it was not broken.<s>
After telling them off for playing inside, John's dad made them all a cake.<s>
The cake had lemon frosting, which was Dave's favorite.<s>
Rose cannot eat lemon, so she let Dave have her slice.<s>
He chose to take Rose's cake home to his Bro.<s>
Dave thanked her a lot.<s>
