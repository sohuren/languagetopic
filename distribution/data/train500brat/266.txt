My mother and I were in the kitchen fixing dinner.<s>
I was setting the table as she was cooking when we heard my father.<s>
We went into the living room to see what he needed.<s>
He could not find the keys to his truck.<s>
We all started looking all over the place and could not seem to find them.<s>
My father needed to go to work so he took the keys for my mom's van and left for work.<s>
We kept looking for them and when we were about to give up my little brother came walking out of the garage with them in his hands.<s>
He was in the garage playing with his bike.<s>
My mother called my father at work to tell him the great news.<s>
He was happy and we then ate our dinner.<s>
