One day when driving home John saw a group of bicycle racers riding down the road.<s>
When they stopped at a store he pulled over to talk to them.<s>
Their names were David, Mark, and Sam.<s>
When he asked them how they got into racing they each had a different story to tell.<s>
Sam started with his dad when he was much younger.<s>
Mark started when he met Sam, who was racing.<s>
David started when he saw a race on TV.<s>
John was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met.<s>
So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost.<s>
Sam said he would give him his old bike for free.<s>
Mark told him of a store nearby, and David told him of a store on the web.<s>
John said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride.<s>
John then went home and left Sam a note so that he could pick up his old bike.<s>
He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing.<s>
