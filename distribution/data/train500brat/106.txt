A man named Jerry lived in a small town in the state of Kentucky.<s>
Jerry owned a sheep farm.<s>
His favorite time of year was when lambs were born.<s>
They were very cute.<s>
Jerry also had other animals on his farm, such as pigs, dogs, cats, and cows.<s>
One day Jerry wanted to paint his barn.<s>
He could not find his ladder.<s>
He looked in the barn, in his house, in his garage, and in his field.<s>
Since he could not find it he had to stand on a table.<s>
It took Jerry six days to paint his barn that way.<s>
Jerry's favorite activity was to sit on his porch and sip lemonade.<s>
He would watch the clouds float by in the sky.<s>
He thought they looked a lot like his sheep.<s>
Every night when Jerry went to sleep, he would listen to the sound of the wind blowing across the fields on his farm.<s>
He would dream about feeding his sheep.<s>
