Mark, Matthew, Zach and John love to play Football.<s>
They did not really care for baseball, basketball or soccer much.<s>
They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs.<s>
Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings.<s>
One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm.<s>
Both boys could not play their favorite games now.<s>
So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home.<s>
When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers.<s>
After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own.<s>
So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game.<s>
After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.<s>
