There was lots to do today.<s>
He woke Tigerrr, his kitty.<s>
They were going to look at the apple trees.<s>
He was seeing if he could grow more fruit by feeding them different kinds of food.<s>
He fed one chips and he fed one chocolate.<s>
He hoped the fruit would taste like apple chocolate!<s>
He fed one root beer and he fed another one salad.<s>
