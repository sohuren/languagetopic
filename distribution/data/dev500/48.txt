Jack and Mackenzie wanted to do something fun during their day off from school.<s>
They knew that the library had story time on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.<s>
Their mother told them they could go to the library every Tuesday for their story time.<s>
They packed up the car and drove to the library, ready for a fun morning.<s>
When they arrived to the story room, there were lots of other children their age, all sitting cross-legged and ready for the story of the day.<s>
The teacher told them they would be reading "The Wild Horse".<s>
She began to tell the story of Majestic, the wild horse who could not be calmed.<s>
His people had tried and tried to break him, but he was wild at heart.<s>
Every time they took him to the river to drink, he would run straight into the water and get soaking wet!<s>
He would splash and play until he was ready to go back home, where he would sleep for hours, having worn himself out playing.<s>
