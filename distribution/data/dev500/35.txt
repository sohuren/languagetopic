Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic.<s>
They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park.<s>
Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright.<s>
Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess.<s>
When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground.<s>
Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter.<s>
Sarah chased Bill all over the playground.<s>
They went in and out and up and down.<s>
Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle.<s>
He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet.<s>
Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day.<s>
Later they sat in the grass for a picnic.<s>
They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes.<s>
Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her.<s>
She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich.<s>
Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich.<s>
Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit.<s>
He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together.<s>
After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds.<s>
Some clouds looked like animals or shapes.<s>
Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer.<s>
Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum.<s>
Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.<s>
