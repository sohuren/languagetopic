Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey.<s>
Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy.<s>
Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing.<s>
One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond.<s>
Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left.<s>
He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie!<s>
Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast.<s>
After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond.<s>
On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit.<s>
They dove into the water and swam for several hours.<s>
The sun was out, but the breeze was cold.<s>
Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home.<s>
Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them.<s>
When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt.<s>
Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots.<s>
The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed.<s>
