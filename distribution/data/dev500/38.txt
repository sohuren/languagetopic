Joe's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks.<s>
Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on.<s>
One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field.<s>
His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself.<s>
Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows.<s>
When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near.<s>
He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did.<s>
He climbed on to the seat and sat there.<s>
Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor.<s>
Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him.<s>
Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast.<s>
When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm.<s>
Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that.<s>
Joe looked at his father and said, "I wanted to be like you."<s>
Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor.<s>
Joe did and after he got a bandage on his arm, he and his father rode in the field on the tractor.<s>
