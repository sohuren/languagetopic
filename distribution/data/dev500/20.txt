One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land.<s>
Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon!<s>
The pink moon felt so lonely.<s>
So, the pink moon called on the sun for help.<s>
The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention.<s>
So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second.<s>
The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky.<s>
Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon!<s>
What are you doing here?<s>
Don't you know the sky is my home during the day?<s>
Your time is coming soon enough.<s>
Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun.<s>
"But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me.<s>
Please let me join your light during the day this once!"<s>
By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart.<s>
The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here.<s>
Come to me now.<s>
Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!"<s>
So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun.<s>
At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun!<s>
The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun!<s>
All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon!<s>
But at that time, the sun slipped away, saying "Farewell, pink moon.<s>
We have to do this again!"<s>
And so, every few years, the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon's is always with us, even in the day time .<s>
