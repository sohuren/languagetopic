Once upon a time there was a little boy who had a rock.<s>
The rock was his favorite toy.<s>
He would throw his rock at trees, or roll his rock down hills.<s>
Sometimes he would stand at the river shore, dropping his rock in the water.<s>
He thought it was great fun to listen to the rock splash.<s>
One day, the little boy met a brown cow.<s>
"Moo!"<s>
said the cow.<s>
"Hello," said the boy.<s>
"Would you like to see my rock?"<s>
The boy held out his rock for the cow to see.<s>
The cow looked at it.<s>
Then it picked it up in its mouth.<s>
"Moo," said the cow.<s>
"Hey," the boy said.<s>
"Give me back my rock!"<s>
The boy tried to pull open the cow's mouth.<s>
Then he tried sticking his fingers in the cow's nose, so it would open its mouth to breathe.<s>
Then he tried tickling the cow, but it wouldn't open its mouth.<s>
"Moo," it said.<s>
Then it swallowed the rock, and the little boy went home and cried.<s>
