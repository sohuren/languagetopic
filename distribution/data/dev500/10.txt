Thunder can move a seesaw.<s>
This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw.<s>
One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house.<s>
It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself.<s>
Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere.<s>
It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end.<s>
As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air!<s>
The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings.<s>
It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds.<s>
When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question.<s>
The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground.<s>
The squirrel fell and fell for a long time.<s>
Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move.<s>
"Where were you?"<s>
the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse.<s>
I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting.<s>
Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away.<s>
So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.<s>
