Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend.<s>
She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color.<s>
When her mom first made it, it was white.<s>
The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night.<s>
Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night.<s>
On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor.<s>
To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him.<s>
She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went.<s>
Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days.<s>
There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him!<s>
So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times.<s>
During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket.<s>
At night, she puts him under her pillow.<s>
She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.<s>
