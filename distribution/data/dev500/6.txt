I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month!<s>
I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day!<s>
She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in.<s>
My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends.<s>
She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework.<s>
When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home.<s>
I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth.<s>
I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too.<s>
Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away.<s>
Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt.<s>
I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.<s>
