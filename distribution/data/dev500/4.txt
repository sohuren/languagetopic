Jane's doll, Samantha, was a magical doll.<s>
Jane kept Samantha hidden from her friends, even Julie, who was her best friend.<s>
Jane didn't want all the other girls from school, like Wanda and Ruth, to find out that she had a magical doll.<s>
Samantha could do things other dolls couldn't.<s>
Jane would whisper in her ear a secret word, and all of a sudden Samantha would come to life, hopping around, running all over.<s>
But Samantha did more than run, she could talk.<s>
Jane told Samantha everything, and Samantha understood.<s>
One day, Jane was naughty and lied to her mother.<s>
Jane's mother put Samantha on top of the refrigerator where Jane could not get to her.<s>
Jane was very sad.<s>
The one person she told everything to was out of her reach.<s>
The next day, Jane had one of the worst days of her life.<s>
She needed to tell someone, but Julie wasn't around.<s>
She needed Samantha.<s>
She had no ladder, chair, or stool to reach her.<s>
Julie moved the kitchen table forward towards the refrigerator, and hopped on top.<s>
She started to climb up to reach for Samantha, and grabbed her quickly.<s>
She came down, dropping Samantha on the floor, and broke Samantha.<s>
Jane whispered the secret word, but Samantha didn't awake.<s>
Samantha's powers were gone.<s>
She couldn't walk, run, talk, or listen.<s>
Jane hurt her the one person she could trust the most.<s>
Then, Samantha moved, looked at Jane, and a tear came from her eye.<s>
Samantha's eyes closed, and she was without life.<s>
She cried no more.<s>
