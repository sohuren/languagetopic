Today is Tommy's birthday!<s>
Everyone is getting ready for his great birthday party.<s>
He's been waiting all week for this day.<s>
His friends start to arrive at his house.<s>
All he wants is a new bike and the time to open presents is getting closer.<s>
After cake and games, his father yells, "Time for presents".<s>
One after another, he sees they are all great presents, fire trucks, coloring books, toys, but there is no bike.<s>
Tommy starts to get upset when he sees that he opened all his presents and he still has no bike.<s>
But right then he sees his mother wheeling a bike through the kitchen into the living room where we are.<s>
He jumps in the air with all the excitement.<s>
He actually got it!<s>
He then runs outside and rides his new bike down the street.<s>
