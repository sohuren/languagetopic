One day Mary took a walk to the park.<s>
The park was very close to her house.<s>
One her way to the park she passed her friend Kim's house.<s>
Mary stopped by and asked if Kim wanted to play.<s>
Kim said yes.<s>
Mary and Kim walked together to the park.<s>
John's house was three houses down.<s>
Mary and Kim stopped by to ask John if he wanted to play at the park.<s>
John said no.<s>
He was afraid of being chased by a squirrel.<s>
Mary worried that John didn't like her, but John thought she was a good friend.<s>
So Mary and Kim went to the park to play.<s>
They loved the park.<s>
They loved the flowers, and the swings!<s>
Soon it was dinnertime and the girls went home.<s>
What a lovely day at the park.<s>
