One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach.<s>
He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived.<s>
Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper.<s>
As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket.<s>
At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant.<s>
As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir!<s>
Can you help me?"<s>
Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet.<s>
"You can talk!"<s>
he shouted.<s>
"Yes," said the bug.<s>
"Please help me!<s>
As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town.<s>
Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home.<s>
I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!"<s>
Stewart felt sad.<s>
"Gee," he cried.<s>
"That sounds terrible!"<s>
Stewart thought about the problem.<s>
"Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said.<s>
The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!"<s>
The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.<s>
The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town.<s>
Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived.<s>
When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him.<s>
Then, he saw something flying around his house.<s>
"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly.<s>
It was the bug!<s>
"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain.<s>
I won't forget your kindness."<s>
After speaking, the butterfly flew away.<s>
Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"<s>
