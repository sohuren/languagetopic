Jimmy swam around the pond.<s>
He was a duck.<s>
He was wet, but he was a duck and didn't care.<s>
He ate some bugs.<s>
He saw some worms on the bottom, but wasn't interested in them, or in the bread crumbs, or the hot dog the boy had dropped.<s>
He kept on swimming and swimming.<s>
He was a mess.<s>
After he had eaten his food, it was afternoon.<s>
The sun was setting, and Jimmy wanted to rest in the sun, and sleep.<s>
He found a nice place to sit, and began to rest.<s>
Falling asleep quickly, he slept for a few hours.<s>
When he woke up it was dark outside.<s>
He had missed dinnertime, but there were always those worms at the bottom of the pond.<s>
Jimmy ate quickly, and was soon ready to swim more.<s>
The pond was small, not a lake, or a river or a stream.<s>
He swam around for a little longer, and soon it was ready for bed in the nest, where he slept with his family Billy, Susie, and Doug.<s>
The other animals were sleeping as well, the dog and the cat on the porch.<s>
The cow was sleeping in the barn.<s>
And last the kittens in their box.<s>
Jimmy was ready for bed, it had been a long day, and the next day was going to be the same.<s>
But Jimmy did not care.<s>
He loved being a duck.<s>
Jimmy was one happy duck.<s>
