Nana had a bunch of money.<s>
She had saved money her whole life.<s>
But Nana was afraid of people stealing her money.<s>
She planned to hide it.<s>
First she moved it around in her house and hid it behind a wall.<s>
Then she put her money in the attic.<s>
But she still didn't feel safe about her money.<s>
She was sure someone would find it.<s>
Finally she took it outside and started digging in the ground.<s>
She buried it in the ground so no one would find it.<s>
"It is going be safe here," said Nana.<s>
She was very pleased that she had hidden her money so well.<s>
The next day after breakfast, she went outside to make sure her money was still there.<s>
She stopped at the spot she thought she had buried it and began digging.<s>
After some time she hadn't found it.<s>
She climbed out of the hole and looked around.<s>
She had used a tree as a way to mark the spot.<s>
But she couldn't tell which tree.<s>
The wind was blowing and the trees all looked the same!<s>
She had used a brown spot on the ground to mark the spot.<s>
But she couldn't tell which brown spot it was!<s>
She knew she wasn't lost.<s>
Nana had hidden her money so well that no one could find it, and that included her!<s>
