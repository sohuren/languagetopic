Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles.<s>
He was black and white and had long floppy ears.<s>
He also had very short legs, but really big paws.<s>
Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game.<s>
Toodles loved playing fetch.<s>
One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there.<s>
He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks.<s>
The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming.<s>
Toodles wasn't having it!<s>
He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates.<s>
One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears!<s>
Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear.<s>
Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.<s>
After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.<s>
