Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends.<s>
Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky.<s>
They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends.<s>
Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt.<s>
When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend.<s>
A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous.<s>
It's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that's what is most important!<s>
Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice.<s>
Having big teeth, sharp claws, and being cranky is not good, and we need to work hard to be the opposite of that to make sure we keep our friends.<s>
