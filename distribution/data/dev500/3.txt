There once lived an elf who was a stinker.<s>
He was real mean to everyone around.<s>
He'd throw pies at girls.<s>
He'd put soap in the fridge.<s>
He'd give the queen shorts as birthday presents.<s>
No one liked the elf.<s>
One day he was planning a way to make someone feel sad.<s>
He thought to draw on someone's head.<s>
He went looking for someone who was asleep so he could draw on them.<s>
He found a boy laying under a tree.<s>
He walked right up to him with his magic marker.<s>
He drew a giant house on the boy's forehead.<s>
The boy woke up and pushed the elf off of him.<s>
The boy knew the elf had done something bad to him so he ran all the way home without looking back.<s>
The elf felt real good about himself.<s>
He had mad the boy sad!<s>
He skipped off and took a swim in a nearby pond.<s>
The boy never talked to the elf again after that.<s>
The elf didn't care and went on annoying people.<s>
