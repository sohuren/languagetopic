Mike wanted to make a cake for his Mom's birthday.<s>
His dad was going to help him.<s>
Mike had eggs, milk, and flour at his house, but no sugar!<s>
Dad told Mike to take his bicycle to the store so he could buy sugar for the cake.<s>
On his way to the store, Mike saw his friend, Sally, at the park.<s>
He rode over to say hello.<s>
Mike and Sally played lots of games at the park.<s>
After a long time, Mike saw it was starting to get dark.<s>
He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time.<s>
Mike rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store.<s>
The store was really big, but Mike found the sugar really fast.<s>
When Mike was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time.<s>
But Mike only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy.<s>
Mike didn't know what to do!<s>
The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy.<s>
But, the toy was so cool!<s>
Mike bought the sugar for his mom's cake, because she was always so nice to him.<s>
He could always get the toy another time.<s>
