Jake was walking to the park to play baseball with his friends.<s>
He loved being outside on sunny days, and now that school was over for the year, he was playing baseball every day.<s>
The more he played, the better he got.<s>
Only Frank was better than he was.<s>
He liked playing third base, but he often played in the field.<s>
He was carrying his favorite mitt that his Grandfather had bought him.<s>
His Grandfather had taught him to catch.<s>
He loved spending time with him when he was younger, but he had moved last year.<s>
Now he only saw his Grandfather in the summer.<s>
Jake was really excited to show him his skills when he came to their next game.<s>
He could throw really fast now.<s>
He was sure his Grandfather would want to sit in the front to watch him.<s>
He knew he would jump up and down.<s>
Jake happily ran the rest of the way to the park thinking about how much fun he was going to have playing baseball this year.<s>
