Steve took his family to the lake.<s>
There are a lot of things to do at the lake.<s>
Steve's favorite thing to do is ride in his red boat across the blue water.<s>
The boat is very loud and makes dark brown smoke.<s>
The boat can go very fast.<s>
Steve has a son named Bobby.<s>
Bobby doesn't like riding in the boat, he prefers to sit on the shore and make lunch.<s>
He makes sandwiches for the whole family.<s>
Bobby loves eating ham sandwiches, but Steve prefers turkey sandwiches.<s>
Bobby's mom also likes to eat ham sandwiches.<s>
Bobby also has a younger sister named Mary.<s>
Mary doesn't like eating sandwiches so she brings one cup of soup and some chips for her lunch.<s>
Mary enjoys fishing at the lake.<s>
She caught two yellow fish, five pink fish and three blue fish.<s>
Mary wants to cook the fish for dinner.<s>
Bobby's mom likes to wear her favorite orange hat.<s>
Her hat also has a big purple flower on top.<s>
She got the hat from Billy who works at the big store down the street.<s>
After Steve's family leaves the lake they all want to go home and eat dinner.<s>
Playing at the lake makes them all very hungry!<s>
