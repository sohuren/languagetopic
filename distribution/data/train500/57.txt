Tom was the best baseball player in his neighborhood.<s>
He also enjoyed playing basketball, but he wasn't very good at it.<s>
Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players.<s>
He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them.<s>
One day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to Tom.<s>
The man said that he worked for the Yankees, and was there to see Tom play!<s>
Tom was so excited he could scream!<s>
Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day.<s>
When he was done, the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack his things right away.<s>
Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes.<s>
His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing.<s>
"I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!"<s>
Tom said.<s>
Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner.<s>
Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake!<s>
As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long.<s>
"Don't worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!"<s>
said his dad.<s>
This made Tom happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.<s>
