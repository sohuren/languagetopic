One morning Julie took her dog, Rosie, for a walk.<s>
Rosie loved to walk outside.<s>
She loved to walk any time - morning, afternoon, or night.<s>
She liked to smell everything.<s>
This morning she smelled something new.<s>
It was another animal.<s>
It was not a squirrel.<s>
It was not another dog.<s>
Maybe it was a tiger!<s>
Rosie sniffed around until she saw the other animal.<s>
It was not a tiger.<s>
It was a cat.<s>
The cat was watching Rosie.<s>
The cat was afraid Rosie would try to bite her, so she climbed up a tree.<s>
Rosie tried to follow her, but she could not climb up.<s>
Instead, she barked at the cat in the tree.<s>
Julie did not want Rosie to scare the cat.<s>
She called Rosie away from the tree.<s>
The cat watched them walk away.<s>
When they came back, the cat was gone.<s>
Rosie remembered the cat.<s>
She started digging in the dirt under the tree.<s>
But there was no cat there.<s>
Julie and Rosie went home for breakfast.<s>
