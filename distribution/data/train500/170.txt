Kramer the kitten loved to hunt for mice.<s>
He was black with white boots.<s>
Kramer was still a baby, so he liked to play all night long and sleep during the day.<s>
His favorite toy is a little fake squeaky mouse.<s>
One day, Kramer was waking up from a long nap.<s>
He saw a little mouse out of the corner of his eye.<s>
He jumped up and began to chase him around the room.<s>
He ran and ran until the mouse went into a little hole in the wall.<s>
Mary the mouse was so scared.<s>
She sat in the hole in the wall and cried little mouse tears.<s>
Kramer heard the mouse crying and said "Don't worry little mouse I want to play with you!<s>
Do you want to play too?<s>
Let's play hide and seek!"<s>
The mouse poked her head out and said "Sure!"<s>
I'm it first!"<s>
And Kramer took off around the corner with Mary chasing behind him.<s>
