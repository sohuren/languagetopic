On Tuesday evening, Rick wanted to play with his friends at a playground near his house.<s>
Rick's mother, Trish, drove him to the playground.<s>
Rick met up with Andrew and Chris.<s>
Rick ran to the monkey bars.<s>
Andrew ran to the slide.<s>
Chris ran to the swings.<s>
Trish sat on a bench near the monkey bars and read a book.<s>
She wanted to finish the book for a long time and wanted to try to finish right now.<s>
Around 6 PM, it started to rain.<s>
Trish quickly put her book inside of her jacket to keep it dry.<s>
Afterwards, she called Rick and his friends over and told them it was time to go.<s>
Rick and Andrew ran to Trish to follow her to the car.<s>
Chris tried to run to Trish but tripped and fell.<s>
He scabbed his knee.<s>
He was in a lot of pain.<s>
Trish told Rick and Andrew to get inside of the car.<s>
She ran to Chris to check on him.<s>
Trish had a bandage in her pocket and put it over Chris' scab.<s>
She then helped Chris get to the car.<s>
The next day, Rick asked Chris if he was okay from the fall at the playground.<s>
Chris said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.<s>
