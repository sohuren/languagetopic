I spent last weekend with my grandma and grandpa.<s>
I love them very much!<s>
I always look forward to visiting them!<s>
They always do fun things with me.<s>
Last weekend, we went to the zoo together.<s>
I saw a great big elephant.<s>
It had a long nose.<s>
My grandpa and I played a game to see who could be the most like an elephant.<s>
We stomped around a lot and made trumpeting noises.<s>
I won!<s>
Grandma looked on and laughed.<s>
I saw a monkeys too!<s>
The monkeys swung through the trees.<s>
They even made monkey noises!<s>
Grandma wanted to take a picture of me with the monkeys, but I was too busy pretending I was monkey to stand still.<s>
After we left the zoo, I went home.<s>
We had dinner together.<s>
Then, my grandma read me a story and tucked me into bed.<s>
I had a great time with my grandparents.<s>
I love them a lot.<s>
I always look forward to visiting them.<s>
