There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes.<s>
In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly.<s>
He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true.<s>
For many years, his life carried on this way.<s>
He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying.<s>
That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star.<s>
He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said.<s>
The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds.<s>
Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly.<s>
If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals.<s>
Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react.<s>
He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings.<s>
Oink's dream was finally coming true.<s>
He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held.<s>
Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also.<s>
He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds.<s>
Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly.<s>
Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends.<s>
But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm.<s>
But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.<s>
Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.<s>
