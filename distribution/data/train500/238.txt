One Thursday morning, John's dad was making him breakfast.<s>
John came downstairs in his favorite blue shirt and fed his dog Bentley.<s>
After washing his hands, John sat down to a hot plate of pancakes, eggs, and bacon.<s>
John's baby sister Emily began to cry in her high chair.<s>
John gave Emily her pink pacifier to calm her down.<s>
After breakfast, John took Bentley out to the backyard to play fetch in the green grass.<s>
John only threw the ball a few times before it started to rain and they had to come back inside.<s>
Bentley shook himself to get the water off him and splashed John.<s>
John's dad asked John, "Do you want to play a game?"<s>
John said that he did and ran to get his favorite board game, Trouble.<s>
When they sat on the living room floor to play, Emily crawled over to sit in John's lap.<s>
Bentley lay next to John's dad with his head on his paws.<s>
John thought this rainy day was perfect.<s>
