It was Saturday and it was nice outside.<s>
I did not have school and my mom did not have work.<s>
When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day.<s>
My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys.<s>
My mom came upstairs and told me, "If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you."<s>
I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room.<s>
My mom left and closed the door.<s>
I looked around and saw how messy my room was.<s>
And I really did not want to clean it.<s>
So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet.<s>
It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise.<s>
She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did.<s>
She was not happy about it.<s>
She said, "You either do it right, or Ill do it right and you won't get a surprise."<s>
That was enough to make me clean my room right.<s>
Finally, my mom told me the surprise when I was all finished.<s>
She told me we were going out to the park!<s>
But by the time we got there, I could only play for a little bit before it started getting dark.<s>
I wished I would have cleaned my room right the first time so I had more time at the park.<s>
