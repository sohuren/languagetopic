It was a terrible day to live in the zoo again for Pauly.<s>
It wasn't a terrible day for Zip, the monkey next to him, or Garth, the giraffe down the sidewalk, or Pat, the alligator in the pond, or for Bam the prairie dog, but it was a terrible day in the monkey cage for Pauly.<s>
Pauly didn't feel he belonged in the monkey cage because he wasn't a monkey.<s>
He was a sailor who had visited the zoo on vacation and fallen asleep on a bench right before closing time.<s>
The zoo worker saw how hairy he was and thought he was a monkey that had escaped from his cage, so they put him in a cage.<s>
Pauly knew if he didn't sleep so deep, none of this would have happened.<s>
He tried to tell the zoo worker the next morning he wasn't a monkey, but the zoo worker knew monkeys liked to play tricks and thought Pauly was a talking monkey that was trying to trick him.<s>
Soon, the zoo worker told others about the talking monkey, and Pauly became famous.<s>
People came from all over to see him.<s>
When the zoo was closed at night Pauly passed the time teaching the real monkeys how to sail.<s>
One day Pauly was asking the people watching him to shave him when James, another sailor on vacation, who knew Pauly, saw him.<s>
When he did, the sailor yelled, "That's no monkey, that's Pauly!"<s>
The zoo worker saw his mistake and sent Pauly away with James in time to join the boat to sail home.<s>
