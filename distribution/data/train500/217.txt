There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.<s>
He would wiggle everywhere he went.<s>
He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.<s>
He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house.<s>
He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.<s>
One day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.<s>
His grandpa was old and liked to cough.<s>
He had a long beard that was grey at the top.<s>
He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much.<s>
So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea.<s>
He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle.<s>
The boy started roaring with laughter.<s>
He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.<s>
The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.<s>
The boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all.<s>
All he could do was walk straight.<s>
That was no fun.<s>
What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted?<s>
The grandpa coughed and smiled.<s>
He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more.<s>
