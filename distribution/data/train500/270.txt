One day, Annette wanted to make a birthday cake for her brother, Todd.<s>
She dug around in their white refrigerator and found she would need to go and buy eggs.<s>
She also needed to buy icing.<s>
Annette got on her pink bike and went to the grocery store.<s>
She asked the cashier to tell her what aisle the icing was on.<s>
Annette went to the aisle 14 and picked out blue, Todd's favorite color.<s>
She then went to get the eggs.<s>
Annette worked for 2 hours making the cake.<s>
She decorated it in the blue icing, and even wrote "Happy Birthday Todd" in neat letters.<s>
Annette's parents made a nice dinner of chicken, red potatoes, and macaroni.<s>
After dinner, Annette and her mom and dad sang to Todd.<s>
He was excited for the cake and to turn 11, and said Annette was the best sister ever.<s>
