The cat woke up from its nap under the couch.<s>
Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there.<s>
He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor.<s>
Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now.<s>
The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen.<s>
A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids.<s>
When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor.<s>
The cat slowly walked up to the can and saw some juice inside.<s>
He licked up the yummy tuna juice and was sad when it was all gone.<s>
The woman brought the tuna sandwiches over to her sons at the table, then she opened the back door to let the dogs in.<s>
The cat's fur stood on end as the dogs came running after him.<s>
He ran away into the other and back to under the couch where it was safe.<s>
