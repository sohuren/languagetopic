It was a beautiful day.<s>
In the morning Tommy and I went to the park to play.<s>
We rode our bikes around and went down to the lake.<s>
We swam around in the lake and splashed water on other kids.<s>
We got back on our bikes and rode back home.<s>
Mommy made lunch.<s>
It was yummy, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk.<s>
Then it was time for our nap.<s>
We woke up and watched some TV.<s>
Mommy gave us some money for candy later.<s>
Tommy and I went back to the park to play.<s>
Tommy and I played with a baseball with some other kids.<s>
Then we played with the football.<s>
We went to the store across the street.<s>
We bought some candy with the money Mommy gave us.<s>
We went back to the park and watched the other kids play as we ate our candy.<s>
It was hot, so we went swimming again.<s>
It was fun!<s>
We like swimming so we go swimming almost every day.<s>
We swam all afternoon until Mommy came down to the park at told us to come home.<s>
Mommy was very upset because we were gone so long.<s>
Mommy was worried that something might have happened to us.<s>
Mommy was not paying attention to her kids and what they were doing for hours.<s>
Tommy and I told Mommy she needs to pay more attention to us.<s>
Mommy started crying, then Tommy and I started crying.<s>
Mommy said from now on, I must pay more attention to you two.<s>
Daddy came home from work and playing softball for his company team.<s>
Daddy wanted to know what was going on.<s>
Daddy saw that we were all crying.<s>
Daddy started to cry too.<s>
We all said that we would pay more attention to each other.<s>
We all said that we would do more things together like going to the park.<s>
We all said we would eat together more often.<s>
