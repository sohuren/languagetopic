Maxine was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river.<s>
She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day.<s>
But her friends, Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like to take baths.<s>
So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend names Thomas.<s>
Thomas loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with Maxine.<s>
But Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like Thomas.<s>
So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean.<s>
She threw rocks and Maxine and Thomas.<s>
Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad.<s>
He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did.<s>
After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths.<s>
They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.<s>
