Joe was a young boy who was excited for his first day of school.<s>
He jumped out of bed with a big smile on his face, ready for school.<s>
He looked in the mirror as he put on his white shirt and blue jeans, and ran down the stairs to get breakfast.<s>
His breakfast was waffles with syrup and eggs.<s>
His favorite breakfasts are pancakes and cereal, but the waffles were good.<s>
After eating all his food, he grabbed his lunch and ran out the door towards the yellow school bus.<s>
He arrived at the bus stop and waited for the bus.<s>
The bus was running late, but then he finally saw the bus pull up to the bus stop.<s>
He did not want to wait one more second so he talked to the bus driver and then took his seat on the bus.<s>
He then took a good look out the window and watched as the bus began driving him to the first day of school he had been waiting for.<s>
Finally, the bus came to a stop.<s>
The children all ran off the bus towards the elementary school.<s>
Joe did not see many other second grade students so he walked to the doors alone.<s>
Once he entered the school, he saw many of his friends from third grade and began talking to them.<s>
Then the bell rang and Joe's first day of school began.<s>
