Tim and Janey woke up earlier than normal.<s>
Their stomach were growling.<s>
They were ready for breakfast.<s>
They had gone to bed at their normal time, but they could not help being up now.<s>
So they woke up their father and went downstairs for breakfast.<s>
It was so early in the morning the sun was not even out yet.<s>
But their dad knew once the kids were up, there was no going back to sleep, so he got started.<s>
He gave them each a banana to start.<s>
He let them pick either a biscuit or toast.<s>
They chose toast.<s>
So he made wheat bread toast and put grape jelly on it.<s>
The quickly ate it and the orange juice they were given.<s>
They then each had a bowl of Rice Krispies before getting showered and dressed.<s>
They kissed their mom as she went to work and began enjoying the day off from school by playing in their rooms.<s>
Dad thought he'd done a good job feeding the kids.<s>
But in two hours, they both were asking for turkey sandwiches for lunch.<s>
With Tim and Janey so hungry so soon, their dad knew he was in for a long day.<s>
And a busy one in the kitchen.<s>
