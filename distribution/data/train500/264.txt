There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals.<s>
By daylight he pretended to be a kind, nice wolf.<s>
By night, he would circle the forest and hunt down his food.<s>
When he was very hungry, he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him.<s>
The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon.<s>
The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it.<s>
Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach.<s>
On other days, he goes home hungry.<s>
Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day.<s>
Those days were the best for the wolf, by far.<s>
