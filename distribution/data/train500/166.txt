There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree.<s>
The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest.<s>
Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat.<s>
Betsy was a very forgetful bat.<s>
One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today!<s>
It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry."<s>
"Do not worry," said Twinkles.<s>
"I am going to wait here for you until you get back."<s>
With that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river.<s>
An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned.<s>
"Hmm," thought Twinkles, "I wonder where Betsy went off to."<s>
Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.<s>
Soon, she heard a voice calling from down below.<s>
"Help me!<s>
I'm stuck!"<s>
Twinkles looked down.<s>
Sure enough, it was Betsy!<s>
She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave.<s>
"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!"<s>
cried Twinkles.<s>
Twinkles swooped down to the ground.<s>
She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud.<s>
Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her.<s>
After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.<s>
"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud!<s>
I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river.<s>
They grow on the bushes there.<s>
I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch.<s>
I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck."<s>
"No problem," said Twinkles.<s>
"That's what friends are for."<s>
