Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.<s>
It was his birthday!<s>
He had been waiting for this day all year long.<s>
He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.<s>
As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!<s>
He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.<s>
He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.<s>
Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.<s>
His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.<s>
He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.<s>
He had really hoped there was a basketball.<s>
The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.<s>
The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.<s>
Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!<s>
He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.<s>
The last box was a square shape.<s>
If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!<s>
He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!<s>
His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.<s>
He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.<s>
His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time.<s>
There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!<s>
