Emilia wished her daughter would eat all her broccoli at suppertime, but it was beginning to seem like it was not going to happen.<s>
She was disappointed and felt a bit like a bad mother.<s>
She wondered how her own mother had gotten her to eat the food when she was a silly little girl like her daughter, Elise.<s>
She grabbed the telephone to ask her mother how she had done it.<s>
She had to wait a second before the older woman picked up, but she was greeted with a happy voice.<s>
She learned from her mother that she had tricked her into believing her broccoli was a forest of trees.<s>
Emilia thought this was a good plan.<s>
After she hung up the phone she picked up her son's pacifier off the floor.<s>
She then washed it off.<s>
She did not want there to be any dirt from the floor on the pacifier.<s>
When he daughter Elise came down the stairs for dinner she told her daughter a story about how she was a giant and broccoli was a small forest of trees.<s>
After that Elise always ate her broccoli.<s>
