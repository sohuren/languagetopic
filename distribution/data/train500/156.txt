Max is a very happy cow.<s>
He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.<s>
He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.<s>
During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn.<s>
The hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.<s>
One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright.<s>
He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him.<s>
But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground.<s>
He had to know why!<s>
So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door.<s>
Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly.<s>
His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy.<s>
"What is this?"<s>
He asked the rooster sitting on the fence.<s>
The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.<s>
"It's snow, son!<s>
Did you grow up in a barn?!"<s>
The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house.<s>
"It's so pretty!"<s>
Max said.<s>
He pushed it with his nose.<s>
"Oh!<s>
It's so chilly!"<s>
He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits.<s>
He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer.<s>
"Max!<s>
What are you doing out here?"<s>
The farmer, named Bob, asked.<s>
He was loud, but not mad.<s>
"It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!"<s>
He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight.<s>
