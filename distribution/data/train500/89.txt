There was once an octopus who lived under the ocean.<s>
His name was Fred.<s>
Fred had never seen the world above the ocean before.<s>
He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named Joey, a sponge named Pam, a star fish named Elaine, and another octopus, Stacey.<s>
So you can imagine his surprise when he found a treasure chest that had been lost by a ship that had sunk.<s>
Inside the chest were things that were completely new to him.<s>
Among these was a whole bunch of food items, such as a bottle of ketchup, a coffee mug, a cherry pie, a sandwich, and more.<s>
When Fred found these things, he wanted to keep them all for himself.<s>
So when he returned to his friends, he didn't tell them what he had found.<s>
When his best friend Stacey asked him where he had been, Fred lied and said that he had only gone for a swim.<s>
But Stacey didn't believe him.<s>
Later on, when Fred was sound asleep in his bed, Stacey visited his room to see what he had been up to.<s>
She went digging around in his room for something interesting.<s>
When she found the treasure chest, she was amazed at what was inside.<s>
But she was also upset at Fred for lying to her, so she woke up him in the middle of the night to yell at him.<s>
Fred understood his mistake and apologized to Stacey, and then they shared the food.<s>
