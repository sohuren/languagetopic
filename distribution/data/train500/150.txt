Today was an important day for Sam: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him!<s>
Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him.<s>
The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking!<s>
He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris.<s>
Sam said hello and petted the dogs.<s>
He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him.<s>
Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice.<s>
Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage!<s>
There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button.<s>
Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers.<s>
Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons.<s>
Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy.<s>
Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons!<s>
Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too!<s>
Sam put his new friend on a leash and took Buttons home with him, and they loved each other very much.<s>
