Ginger and Joey were two young dogs.<s>
They were happy because it was now the summer and they could play outside more often.<s>
Today Ginger and Joey were running around in their big backyard.<s>
They had fun barking at many things.<s>
They barked at squirrels.<s>
They barked at a bus.<s>
They barked at the mailman.<s>
They barked at a weird bug.<s>
They barked so much, they were never quiet!<s>
The neighbor was a grumpy old man.<s>
His name was Bert.<s>
Bert threw a shoe at them because they were barking too much.<s>
He couldn't take a nap because they were so loud.<s>
Bert got too angry and Bert throws things when he gets too angry.<s>
The shoe missed both Ginger and Joey, but they barked a little less.<s>
Now they ran even faster.<s>
After a very long time, they began to get tired.<s>
They sniffed around the edges of the yard and found some old watermelon.<s>
That's a good snack for young dogs like Ginger and Joey!<s>
Next, they rolled around in the dirt.<s>
Then they chased their tails.<s>
Finally, their mom came out and told them to come inside.<s>
They were so dirty, they needed a bath.<s>
Ginger loved baths and jumped right into the tub.<s>
Joey was scared and ran away to hide.<s>
After a little bit, his mom found him and he got a bath in the end, too.<s>
