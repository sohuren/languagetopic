There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm.<s>
He was a very cute animal, and he knew it.<s>
He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could.<s>
When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat.<s>
This helped keep the mud off.<s>
He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.<s>
This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty.<s>
"You shouldn't stay so clean!"<s>
she told him.<s>
"We're pigs!<s>
We love the mud!"<s>
But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat.<s>
One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch.<s>
They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in.<s>
But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it.<s>
He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty.<s>
He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill.<s>
They were getting brown mud all over them.<s>
"Come on," said his aunt.<s>
"You can get some bread crumbs on yourself.<s>
It's okay."<s>
But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue.<s>
Suddenly, a car drove up.<s>
The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig.<s>
The tiny big was sad and mad.<s>
But then the people in the car got out.<s>
"Look at how cute that little muddy pig is!"<s>
said one.<s>
"He's so cute!"<s>
said the other.<s>
"Really?"<s>
said the tiny pig.<s>
"Yes!"<s>
said his aunt.<s>
"For the last time, everybody knows that pigs get muddy!"<s>
So the tiny pig went and dug in to the food with all the other pigs.<s>
He ate a big piece of bread.<s>
He got crumbs all over himself.<s>
