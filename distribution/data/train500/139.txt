Jake and Carol live next door to a banana farm.<s>
One day as they were taking a walk, Jake asked Carol if she could smell the sweet bananas.<s>
Carol said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some.<s>
Jake's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas.<s>
They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some.<s>
When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night.<s>
He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in Orangeville.<s>
Instead of waiting for the farmer to return so that they could ask for some bananas, Jake and Carol began walking around the farm to pick their own.<s>
As he was walking, Jake tripped on a rock.<s>
As he tried to stand back up he felt a sharp pain in his leg.<s>
He could walk, but it was very painful.<s>
Carol let Jake lean on her as they walked home.<s>
They knew it was a bad idea to go on the farmer's land without his permission and would never do it again.<s>
