There was once a leprechaun named Tony who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal.<s>
Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl.<s>
That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven.<s>
Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky.<s>
So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on Earth.<s>
One day, she came across Tony's rainbow, and was amazed by it.<s>
She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there.<s>
Then she saw it: Tony's golden bowl.<s>
From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.<s>
She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself.<s>
When she went to have some of the cereal, Tony the Leprechaun popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her.<s>
"Don't you know," he said, "that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land?<s>
What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?"<s>
The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him.<s>
So she left to find something to trade.<s>
She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting.<s>
She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw."<s>
When Tony saw the seesaw, he loved it.<s>
He didn't argue or laugh at Jess, and traded for his bowl right there.<s>
Jess ate from it, and it was delicious.<s>
