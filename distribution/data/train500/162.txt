Jimmy loved watching television.<s>
He would wake up and watch Cartoons on Cartoon Network.<s>
His favorite cartoon was Scooby Doo.<s>
After his mom picked him up at the bus stop, he would go home and watch the Flintstones.<s>
One day, his mom told him he was not allowed to watch cartoons after school.<s>
He was very sad.<s>
She told him he had to go outside to play.<s>
He walked into the backyard.<s>
Fido was running around.<s>
He started to chase him.<s>
He picked up a ball and threw it.<s>
Fido ran after it and brought it back.<s>
Jimmy laughed.<s>
He chased after Fido and scratched his back.<s>
Maybe being outside wasn't so bad after all!<s>
He played with Fido for another hour until his mom called him inside.<s>
It was dinner time.<s>
Dinner was fried chicken and mashed potatoes-his favorite.<s>
He was happy his mom made him go outside.<s>
He would go outside every day after school now!<s>
