I once went on a week-long backpacking trip through the mountains.<s>
We had a lot of fun and saw a lot of animals.<s>
We saw two bears on the first.<s>
We also saw one buffalo.<s>
During the week we climbed four different mountains.<s>
The best day of the trip was the last day.<s>
On the last day we heard that one of best things to do was to climb the last mountain at night so that way you could watch the sunrise on top of the mountain.<s>
We had to wake up at two in the morning to do the climb.<s>
It was very tough to climb a mountain at night.<s>
We finally got to the top of the mountain at five in the morning.<s>
We watched the sunrise an hour later at six in the morning.<s>
It was very beautiful.<s>
In fact, at one time because of the rise of the mountain you it was daytime in front of us and nighttime behind us.<s>
This was one of the best times in my life.<s>
