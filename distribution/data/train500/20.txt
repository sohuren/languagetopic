The pink rabbit is sitting on a bench in the park.<s>
The pink rabbit loves being at the park because she loves bird watching.<s>
She watches birds, and sometimes feeds them.<s>
She doesn't feed them corn, candy bars, or pizza.<s>
She feeds them sunflower seeds.<s>
Across from the pink rabbit, a blue dinosaur is sitting alone at a seesaw.<s>
The blue dinosaur likes playing on the seesaw because he thinks it's fun.<s>
The blue dinosaur is sad, because he can't ride on the seesaw by himself.<s>
The pink rabbit sees the blue dinosaur.<s>
She sees that he is by himself.<s>
She feels sad because she knows he cannot play on the seesaw.<s>
The pink rabbit hops over to the blue dinosaur and asks, "Would you ride the seesaw with me?"<s>
The blue dinosaur said, "Sure."<s>
And they rode on the seesaw for the rest of the afternoon.<s>
It was the best afternoon of their lives.<s>
