Annie was helping her little brother Max pick flowers from the garden.<s>
They wanted to put the flowers in a jar to put on the kitchen table.<s>
Mother's Day was the next day and their mother loved fresh flowers.<s>
After they picked flowers and put them in a jar, Max asked Annie if they could have a snack.<s>
Annie took Max into the kitchen and got out an apple to slice up.<s>
They sat down at the table looking at the flowers and ate their apple slices.<s>
There was a window in the kitchen that let in sunlight.<s>
"Hey!"<s>
Max said, pointing at one of the roses in the jar.<s>
"There's something moving on that rose."<s>
Annie looked more closely at the flowers.<s>
"It's a ladybug," she said.<s>
"We need to take it back outside."<s>
Suddenly the ladybug began flying around the kitchen.<s>
Max jumped up and ran around trying to catch it.<s>
At last he clapped his hands around it.<s>
"Careful!"<s>
said Annie.<s>
Max walked outside and let the ladybug go.<s>
