There once was a pumpkin.<s>
The pumpkin was sad.<s>
The pumpkin wanted to leave the garden and see the world.<s>
But the pumpkin had to stay in the garden because its vine held it there.<s>
One day a fox came by.<s>
The pumpkin asked the fox to cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.<s>
The fox said it would cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.<s>
When the fox cut the vine the pumpkin could roll around.<s>
The pumpkin rolled around until it got out of the garden.<s>
First it met a cat.<s>
It told the cat it was happy because now it could see the world.<s>
The cat gave the pumpkin a piece of cake to eat.<s>
The pumpkin could not eat the cake because it had no mouth but it was still very happy to have the cat as a new friend.<s>
