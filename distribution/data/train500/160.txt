Linda was very excited when she woke up this morning.<s>
It was finally the last day of school and she was going to get the whole summer off.<s>
She was so excited because this summer she and her family would be traveling to France.<s>
She had always wanted to visit Europe after her friend Susan visited Spain and Italy the summer before and came back knowing all sorts of funny words.<s>
She was going to get to see the Eiffel Tower, try all kinds of new food, and meet a whole bunch of new people.<s>
She was a bit worried because she didn't speak any French.<s>
She wanted to meet some of the people there and become friends.<s>
She didn't know how well that would work if she couldn't talk with them.<s>
Overall she was still quite excited.<s>
She would miss seeing her friends at home this summer.<s>
If she were in France she would miss the happy days of playing baseball with Tommy and Susan or going to movies to hide from the heat with her good friend Lilly, or getting lost wandering in the woods behind her house.<s>
Oh well, it was time to get ready for school, she would have to enjoy this last day with them before heading out on her adventure.<s>
