The kitty did not want to freeze, so it found a place to stay warm in a trashcan near a bush.<s>
The kitty had been left outside in the rain, but some friendly people thought that they would let it in when they found it in the trashcan outside.<s>
They gave the kitty some water to sip, and food to eat.<s>
When the phone would ring, the kitty would run and hide.<s>
The kitty would hide in the bathroom.<s>
Sometimes, the kitty would take its food into the bedroom and eat it there.<s>
The kitty's claws were so sharp that they ended up cutting everything that it scratched.<s>
The kitty also scratched the finger of one of the nice people.<s>
When the rain stopped, the nice people put the kitty back outside.<s>
They put it outside because it was making them sneeze.<s>
The kitty left their home happy and with a full stomach.<s>
All of its kitty friends were waiting for it.<s>
