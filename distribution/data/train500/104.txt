Tommy was a little boy who lived by a big lake by the woods.<s>
One day he saw two little mice looking at the water.<s>
They seemed very sad.<s>
"What is wrong?"<s>
Tommy asked.<s>
Mary, one of the little mice, stood.<s>
"My brother and I love to see new things.<s>
We want to see what is on the other side of the lake.<s>
But we do not know how to build a boat to get there."<s>
Tommy smiled.<s>
"I have plenty of toy boats," he said.<s>
"They are your size!"<s>
"Oh, thank you!"<s>
said Steve, the other little mouse.<s>
"We would be very glad if we could borrow it!"<s>
Tommy went to his house and returned with a small toy boat.<s>
The boat had a big sail to make the boat go.<s>
Mary and Steve climbed on and Tommy put the boat into the water.<s>
The boat sailed away across the water!<s>
Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat.<s>
Soon, they reached the other side of the lake.<s>
Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water.<s>
Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people.<s>
A man threw a ball into the water.<s>
It landed by the toy boat.<s>
The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it.<s>
The big waves splashed the little boat every which way!<s>
Mary and Steve got very wet.<s>
Mary and Steve went back home after that.<s>
They told Tommy of what they saw, and they all laughed at the big dog's wave.<s>
Tomorrow the mice would see even more of the lake on Tommy's toy boat!<s>
