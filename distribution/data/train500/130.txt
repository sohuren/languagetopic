A single parent took their child on a trip.<s>
The trip was to the playground.<s>
The child had a fear of the playground, because she had dug a hole and it had made her trip once.<s>
The parent put the child on the sofa and put her shoes on, telling her that it would be alright, and they would be back home by nine.<s>
At the playground, the child met a witch.<s>
The witch had a piggy with her.<s>
The witch stood in the middle of the street.<s>
She had a broom.<s>
The child wondered what there was to sweep at the playground.<s>
Instead, the witch made a chicken, and gave some of it to the child.<s>
The witch was saying that it was a gift for her.<s>
She thought a gift would help the child with her fear.<s>
The child ate the chicken.<s>
Then she asked the witch a question.<s>
She asked what the witch had a broom for.<s>
The witch laughed.<s>
She told the girl it was to fly with.<s>
The girl did not believe her.<s>
The witch sat on her broom and flew away.<s>
In the distance, a dog howled.<s>
