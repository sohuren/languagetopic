Jill was a normal student.<s>
However, she was barely passing her classes this year.<s>
Her finals were coming up in a few weeks and Jill was very nervous about her Math test.<s>
She was never very good at Math.<s>
Her brother always teased her because he was great at Math, History, and Science, but she preferred Art.<s>
To raise her grades, Jill spent the week before finals studying every day in the school library.<s>
On the last day before the test, Jill walked in and was ready to work hard like she had every day that week.<s>
Except this time she looked over and saw her best friend, Michelle, walking up to her.<s>
Michelle greeted Jill and told her that she wants to help her study for the Math test.<s>
The two girls spend the rest of the afternoon looking over their class notes.<s>
By the end of the day, Jill finally felt ready.<s>
She left and walked back to her house.<s>
That night Jill made sure to get lots of sleep.<s>
She awoke early and had a filling breakfast before making her way to school.<s>
Her teacher, Mr. Matthews, handed out the Math tests and she began to work.<s>
She felt like she did a really good job, but she was scared, too.<s>
Jill had to wait until tomorrow to see how she did.<s>
The next day she hurried back to class.<s>
Jill walked in and grabbed her test from the stack of papers.<s>
She let out a yell.<s>
Jill had failed.<s>
She turned to her friend Michelle and started to cry.<s>
She was so upset.<s>
