Barry the bowl lived in a cabinet in the kitchen.<s>
He sat next to the pots and under the pans.<s>
He liked his home, but he never got out much.<s>
He was only used for mixing when his friend wanted to bake a cake.<s>
One day, his friend pulled him out of the cabinet and put him on the table.<s>
He got out the eggs, flour and sugar and began to bake a cake.<s>
Barry was very excited.<s>
He looked around the kitchen as his friend mixed up all the ingredients.<s>
He saw a sink, a refrigerator and a toaster.<s>
He was sad to go back in the cabinet when his friend was all done with the cake.<s>
But he wasn't going back yet!<s>
His friend set him in the sink to wash out all of the leftover ingredients.<s>
It was a fun day out of the cabinet.<s>
Now it was time for him to go back home and wait for another day and another adventure.<s>
