John was a very naughty boy.<s>
He liked playing tricks on people.<s>
Sometimes he would call Mrs. Walker at the hat store and roar at her on the phone.<s>
Sometimes he would leave his wet blanket on the sidewalk so that it would squish under people's feet when they walked past.<s>
Sometimes he would moo at his sister, June, to annoy her.<s>
One time he even painted his friend Jack's bedroom purple without asking.<s>
This upset Jack very much.<s>
Jack did not want his bedroom to be purple.<s>
Jack liked his bedroom blue and white, like his favorite sport's team.<s>
Whenever Jack was sad his dog, Scamp, was also sad.<s>
John's naughty actions really hurt Jack's feelings so he tried to hide from John.<s>
John found Jack anyway.<s>
"Why are you hiding from me?"<s>
asked John.<s>
"You were naughty.<s>
You painted my bedroom without asking.<s>
You even made Scamp sad and now his tail won't wag."<s>
John felt very bad about hurting his friend's feelings.<s>
He wanted to make his friend happy again.<s>
The problem was he was out of paint.<s>
John thought long and hard.<s>
He had an idea!<s>
He ran to his house and grabbed his favorite toy, his yellow dinosaur.<s>
He handed it to Jack.<s>
"I'm sorry about your room.<s>
I won't do anything like that again.<s>
I can't fix it right now, but you can have my dinosaur until I fix your room."<s>
Jack accepted John's apology and both boys were happy.<s>
Scamp could wag his tail again.<s>
