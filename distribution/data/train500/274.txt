There was once an alligator who liked to wear orange sweaters.<s>
He liked that is was orange instead of a boring color like white or black.<s>
All of the other alligators would laugh and point at him and say mean things about him.<s>
They would say it was silly for an alligator to wear a sweater.<s>
One night it got very cold and the ground was very hard.<s>
The alligator rested well with his sweater to keep his tummy warm and protected from the cold ground.<s>
After that night all of the alligators wore different colored sweaters (red, blue, green, and yellow) and were safe and warm from the cold weather.<s>
They thanked him and apologized for laughing before.<s>
The point of this story is that sometimes silly ideas turn out to be the best ideas and we shouldn't make fun of others.<s>
