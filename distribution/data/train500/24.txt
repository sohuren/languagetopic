I love to bake cakes for my granddaughter Abigail.<s>
She gets so happy when she eats them!<s>
So one day, I thought I'd surprise her at school with cake for her school class!<s>
I thought that would make her love me even more.<s>
I went into the kitchen and washed my hands.<s>
Then I dried them on a dishtowel.<s>
I went to the refrigerator and took out my cake mix.<s>
Then I took out the special bottle of vanilla sauce!<s>
I always pour it in for Abigail.<s>
Her mom and dad like orange sauce, but Abigail loves vanilla sauce.<s>
I mixed it in with the cake mix, and put it on the table.<s>
Then I went to turn on the oven.<s>
Then, a bad thing happened!<s>
My friendly old cat Billy jumped up to smell the mix!<s>
Billy also loves vanilla sauce!<s>
But then Billy accidently kicked the mix!<s>
It fell all the way from the table to the ground.<s>
My lip tightened as I started to cry.<s>
Now, Abigail wouldn't have a cake for her class.<s>
What a silly Billy!<s>
