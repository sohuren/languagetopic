Joe lives in a big city with his mother and father.<s>
His father is called Tony, and his mother's name is Clarissa.<s>
He likes to go to all the stores and look at the things inside.<s>
Sometimes if Joe sees something he likes, his parents buy it for him.<s>
Last week, they were in a store and Joe saw a ball that he wanted.<s>
Joe's father bought it for him, and Joe was very happy.<s>
Joe's grandmother doesn't live in the city.<s>
She lives on a farm.<s>
Her name is Hazel.<s>
Sometimes Joe's parents take him to visit his grandmother.<s>
There are not many stores around where she lives.<s>
But Joe is always excited to see her, because there are many things there that are not found in cities.<s>
The first time he saw a cow, Joe was scared, because he had never seen a cow in the city.<s>
There are always a lot of animals near Joe's grandmother's house.<s>
Sometimes there are chickens and pigs and ducks.<s>
Joe's favorite animal is Max.<s>
Max is Hazel's dog.<s>
He is a friendly dog.<s>
He doesn't bark at the other animals.<s>
Sometimes Joe and Max play with a ball.<s>
Max likes to play with Joe.<s>
Sometimes Max doesn't like strangers, but Max has seen Joe a few times, so now they are friends.<s>
Hazel is a very good cook.<s>
She always makes Joe's favorite breakfast: eggs, pancakes, and bacon.<s>
Sometimes Joe's mother makes the same meals for him, but Hazel's food is always better.<s>
Joe is sometimes sad when he leaves Hazel's house.<s>
But he knows that he is going to return, so he is not sad for long.<s>
