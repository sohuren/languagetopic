Becky was really smart.<s>
She knew how to spell really well.<s>
She won every spelling prize from her teacher.<s>
Her teacher told her that soon the whole school would have a spelling test.<s>
Becky wanted to get the highest grade.<s>
Her two best friends were going take it too.<s>
She dreamed that they would all get prizes.<s>
Every day she practiced spelling new words.<s>
Her family always laughed.<s>
"Is that a spelling word Becky?"<s>
they would ask.<s>
Then they would all practice it together.<s>
Becky walked with her dog to school each day excited.<s>
Soon the day of the test arrived.<s>
Becky was not nervous.<s>
She had eaten a big breakfast.<s>
She had worn her lucky socks.<s>
She had spelled every single word she knew out loud.<s>
When Becky got her test, she picked up her sharpened pencil and happily started writing her name.<s>
The spelling test was going to be hard, but she could do it!<s>
