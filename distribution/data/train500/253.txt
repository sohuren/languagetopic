"That one looks like a flower.<s>
And that one looks like a boat.<s>
There's one that looks like my dog!"<s>
she says to herself.<s>
She is always surprised and happy to find a new shape.<s>

She watches and studies all the butterflies, bees, ants, spiders, and even worms that are in her backyard.<s>
