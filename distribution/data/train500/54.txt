One upon a time there was a dragon named Jack.<s>
He was large and had big scales, but did not have claws or a mean look on his face like other dragons did.<s>
He also didn't have wings and couldn't fly.<s>
Jack lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.<s>
This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named Ryan.<s>
The castle was old and dirty.<s>
It wasn't clean or special like many castles are thought to look.<s>
One day Jack thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when Ryan was sleeping that night.<s>
After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.<s>
After passing many sleeping guards, Jack put his nose near the princess's tower window.<s>
She climbed out on to it and they ran off.<s>
During their escape, Ryan woke up and started chasing them.<s>
However, he was too sleepy to catch them.<s>
Jack took the princess to a nearby safe town where she thanked him and said goodbye.<s>
