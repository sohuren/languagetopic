One day a young princess named Amelia was looking out of the window of her castle.<s>
Amelia loved to sing, but was tired of singing only the songs her mother, Queen Anne, allowed her to sing.<s>
Princess Amelia thought it might be fun to write her own songs instead.<s>
So, on Saturday Princess Amelia went to the garden with a pen and paper.<s>
She thought and thought, but couldn't come up with any words for a song.<s>
What could she write about?<s>
Daisy, her cow?<s>
Her frog, Pete?<s>
Nothing came to mind.<s>
She sat there all day.<s>
And the next day too.<s>
Amelia was tired and hungry.<s>
But she wanted to stay until she had a song.<s>
Finally, on Monday, Queen Anne came looking for Amelia and forced her to return to her room.<s>
She gave Amelia a large book of songs to sing.<s>
Amelia was happy.<s>
