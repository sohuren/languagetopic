Andy the lion lived in Africa.<s>
He was a happy lion, and he liked to lay in the sun all day.<s>
One day when Andy got hungry, he thought about strawberries.<s>
He had never had a strawberry before.<s>
"Oh," he thought, "strawberries must be very tasty."<s>
He thought about how red they were, and how sweet they must taste.<s>
"I have to have a strawberry," said Andy.<s>
So Andy went to talk to his friends, to find out if they had any strawberries.<s>
He walked to a big field where he saw his friend Billy the Bison.<s>
Andy asked Billy if he had any strawberries.<s>
"No, I don't," said Billy, "All I have is a banana."<s>
Andy was sad, because he really wanted a strawberry, but he wouldn't stop there.<s>
Andy walked to the river to find his friend Charlie, the duck.<s>
It was a long way to walk, but Andy really wanted a strawberry.<s>
When he finally got there, he asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"<s>
"No," said Charlie, "I only have is an apple."<s>
This made Andy really sad, but he wouldn't stop there.<s>
Andy knew that he only knew one other friend who might have a strawberry, and that was David the Elephant.<s>
So he walked and walked and walked until he was finally at his friend David's house.<s>
Andy was tired, but wouldn't give up.<s>
Andy asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"<s>
David said, "Yes!<s>
Help yourself."<s>
Andy was excited, and finally tasted his first strawberry.<s>
Andy thought it was tasty.<s>
