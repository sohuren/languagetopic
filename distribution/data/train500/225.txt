One day, Jane and Mike went to the zoo with their mother.<s>
As soon as they arrived, Jane said she wanted to go see the bears and the lions.<s>
Mike didn't want to see them at all, he wanted to see the monkeys.<s>
Their mother told them that they can see all of the animals, but they have to start with the sneaky snakes.<s>
After going around to some of the animals, Mike was happy to finally see the monkeys.<s>
As soon as they started to watch the monkeys, they started dancing by the window in front of Mike, Jane, and their mother.<s>
"Look!<s>
Mike," their mother said, "those monkeys are dancing for you!"<s>
and Mike watched them happily dance and dance!<s>
When they stopped dancing, their mother told Jane it was time to see some scary lions and bears.<s>
Jane wasn't scared at all, she knew they weren't going to get her.<s>
Jane bravely went to the section with the lions and watched them roaring at her and Mike.<s>
Mike got scared and hid behind his mom.<s>
Jane was happy watching the lions.<s>
Next was the bears, but they were all asleep by the time they got to see them.<s>
At the end of the day, Mike said he loved the monkeys the best, Jane said she loved the lions.<s>
Both, Jane and Mike, said they loved the zoo.<s>
