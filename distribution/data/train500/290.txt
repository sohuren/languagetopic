One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.<s>
We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it.<s>
We piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me.<s>
I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.<s>
I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip.<s>
When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play.<s>
I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad.<s>
After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water.<s>
It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day.<s>
As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells.<s>
I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in.<s>
They would be great to add to my collection at home.<s>
When I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle.<s>
We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels.<s>
When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it.<s>
I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.<s>
When we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately.<s>
It was a very good day that I'll always remember.<s>
