A boy woke up super excited for this special day.<s>
He could not contain his excitement knowing that the soccer final was today!<s>
He had been working all year long to get to this day.<s>
He quickly hopped off his bed and went to eat his breakfast.<s>
His mom had made pancakes, waffles, and eggs, but the boy felt like eating cereal.<s>
His mom had laid out his soccer clothes and after he was done with his breakfast, he couldn't wait to put them on.<s>
He quickly changed into the clothes, and ran to the car where his mom was waiting for him to get in.<s>
The ride seemed to take a long time as he was super excited to play.<s>
The team was there and they started a small practice before the big game!<s>
The game started and the boy was very nervous since the other team looked really good.<s>
His team was as good too and they were tied at the end!<s>
Everyone either got a trophy or a medal for playing in the game, and the boy got a trophy.<s>
It was one of the best times the boy had ever had.<s>
The day was starting to get dark and he could feel sprinkles on his hands.<s>
His parents asked the boy if he wanted to eat ice cream and pizza after the game.<s>
The boy said he was tired and went home with his parents and he could not stop talking about how super fun the game was.<s>
He talked and talked and talked and his parents were very proud of him.<s>
He talked so much that he fell asleep in the car!<s>
His dad carried him into the house and put him in his bed.<s>
The boy had such a great day that he dreamed of soccer all night long.<s>
The trophy he had been given would let him remember about the fun day he had.<s>
