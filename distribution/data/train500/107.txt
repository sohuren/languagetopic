Ferra the car was sad.<s>
Her wheels were dirty.<s>
Her doors were dirty.<s>
Her hood was dirty and her windows were dirty too.<s>
There was mud from splashing in puddles.<s>
There was grass stuck to the mud from playing tag in the yard.<s>
And there were leaves from jumping in leaf piles.<s>
It was a busy day.<s>
Now Ferra wanted a nap.<s>
But if she went to sleep in the garage it would get all dirty.<s>
Ferra's mom said 'Come here.<s>
I can give you a bath and you can be squeaky clean' So Ferra let her mom give her a nice bath with big bubbles.<s>
When she was done, Ferra went to take a nap in the garage, all happy and squeaky clean.<s>
