On Tuesday, Timmy went to go visit his grandma for the day.<s>
She lived in a town close to where Timmy lived, so Timmy got in the car and his mom drove him to his grandma's house.<s>
Timmy wanted to bring his big white dog with him, but his mom said no because his grandma doesn't like dogs.<s>
Instead, Timmy brought his favorite toys: a blue car, a puzzle with a picture of green trees on it, and a few fun board games in brown boxes.<s>
When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him.<s>
She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him.<s>
"Hi, Timmy!"<s>
She said.<s>
"Hi, Grandma!"<s>
Timmy said.<s>
"I'm so happy to see you!"<s>
Grandma smiled.<s>
"We're going to have so much fun today, Timmy.<s>
I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you."<s>
"Wow, Grandma, that sounds great!<s>
I brought some games for us to play.<s>
This is going to be a great day!"<s>
Grandma and Timmy went inside Grandma's house and Timmy opened his bag of toys to show Grandma.<s>
She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at Timmy.<s>
"Well, Timmy, what do you want to do first?"<s>
She asked.<s>
Timmy chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together.<s>
Then, they ate lunch.<s>
The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious.<s>
Timmy ate three whole cookies by himself.<s>
After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested.<s>
It was starting to get dark out.<s>
"I had a great day, Timmy," Grandma said.<s>
Timmy smiled.<s>
"Me too, Grandma.<s>
I love spending time with you!"<s>
Timmy thought it had been a perfect day, even if he couldn't bring his dog.<s>
