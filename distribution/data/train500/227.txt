It's finally the weekend of Halloween and I get to dress up in my lion costume.<s>
Halloween is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up.<s>
Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion.<s>
My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything.<s>
He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay.<s>
His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them.<s>
My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving.<s>
But I love Halloween.<s>
We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat.<s>
While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner.<s>
She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get.<s>
I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house.<s>
His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend.<s>
I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember.<s>
I don't think pirates are very cool, but I didn't tell Kevin that.<s>
I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs.<s>
Tonight is going to be the best Halloween ever.<s>
