Emily and her mother enjoy doing things together often.<s>
Many days they like to go to the park or to the swimming pool but today they chose to go to the grocery store.<s>
They went into the store and straight to look at the fruit.<s>
Emily looked at the lemons, the bananas, the apples and the pears.<s>
In the end, Emily chose the apples and put them in a bag.<s>
She handed the bag to her mother to put into their shopping cart.<s>
The pair went to the dairy section next and looked at the kinds of yogurt they store had.<s>
There was blueberry, peach, strawberry and vanilla.<s>
Emily asked her mother what kind of yogurt they would be getting and her mother said they wanted the blueberry yogurt.<s>
When they got to the checkout, Emily helped her mother when they needed to pay.<s>
Emily gave the cashier two dimes and four pennies.<s>
They gathered up their bags, packed them into their car and drove home.<s>
