Paul worked as a cook in a restaurant.<s>
For Valentine's Day, he made chocolate desserts.<s>
He tripled the recipe to feed all the people.<s>
He separated the eggs and measured the sugar.<s>
Then he melted the chocolate.<s>
He mixed the egg whites until they made a thick foam.<s>
He mixed the egg yolks with the sugar.<s>
But as he was ready to mix everything, his boss asked him to do a different job.<s>
Paul chopped some vegetables.<s>
When he came back, Greg had taken over his work and made a mistake.<s>
The mix was much too thin.<s>
It looked like chocolate soup.<s>
It wouldn't rise at all.<s>
Luckily Paul was ready.<s>
He had practiced the dessert recipe before.<s>
It looked like it didn't have enough egg whites.<s>
Paul separated more eggs and mixed the egg whites.<s>
He added the extra egg whites to the mix.<s>
His addition worked.<s>
The desserts rose high in the oven.<s>
He saved the day!<s>
