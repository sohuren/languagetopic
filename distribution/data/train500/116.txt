There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt).<s>
He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster.<s>
Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around.<s>
One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it.<s>
Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather.<s>
"If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!"<s>
yelled Gary, who was cold.<s>
"Don't worry, no one's going to die!"<s>
yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary.<s>
Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean.<s>
They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.<s>
