There was a cat.<s>
Her name was Maggie.<s>
Maggie was a large cat.<s>
She was not tall but rather round.<s>
She was happy most of the time.<s>
Maggie lived with a family that loved her very much.<s>
They all lived in the city together downtown.<s>
They were no other animals that lived with them.<s>
They lived in an apartment.<s>
Maggie was lucky because she and her family lived on the ground floor and they had a big back yard that had a fence.<s>
This meant she got to go outside and play!<s>
Maggie's family loved her very much.<s>
She knew this because they took such good care of her.<s>
She had her very own purple cat bed.<s>
She loved her bed, and purple.<s>
This was her favorite color and her favorite place to sleep.<s>
If she did not sleep on the lap of one of her family this was her favorite place to sleep.<s>
She also knew that they loved her because they made sure to feed her every day.<s>
In fact, they fed many times a day.<s>
This is why she was so large.<s>
One day when she was in the yard a group of street cats came up to her.<s>
"Oink, oink" they said in mean voices.<s>
They were teasing her because she was so big.<s>
She did not know that other cats thought that being big was a bad thing.<s>
She knew they were upset because they did not have a family to feed them.<s>
Maggie went in and meowed to the family to come feed these new cats.<s>
They did, and from then on, every day, they came to Maggie's to eat, and Maggie became the most popular girl in the neighborhood.<s>
