Juan and Amy were happy because they were going to help their mom make a cake.<s>
They were making the cake for their dad who was returning from a long trip.<s>
Amy thought about all the things she wanted to do with her dad when he got back.<s>
They would go to the park and he could push her on the swing then they could take their dog for a walk and have a long talk like they used to do.<s>
Juan was also thinking about all the things he and his dad could do when he got back.<s>
Maybe they could all go to the river like last year and his dad could teach him how to skip stones across the river.<s>
They could share hotdogs like last year too.<s>
"What are you two doing in here?"<s>
Their mom asked.<s>
"We are waiting to help you with Dad's cake."<s>
Juan said.<s>
"Okay, you two get out the yogurt for the frosting and I am going to start the oven to get it warmer."<s>
"Oh no!<s>
I spilled the punch when Juan was closing the door."<s>
Amy cried.<s>
"It is okay we can clean that up in no time."<s>
Juan said and grabbed the paper towels.<s>
Just as their mom was mixing the cake ingredients Juan and Amy heard their dog bark.<s>
"Mom!<s>
The dog is barking someone is here."<s>
Juan said.<s>
"Well your dad is not going to be here until this afternoon.<s>
You two wait here."<s>
She said and walked out of the kitchen.<s>
Her husband opened the door and smiled at her.<s>
She hugged him and they walked into the kitchen together.<s>
"Daddy!"<s>
Juan and Amy shouted and ran to hug him.<s>
"I missed you guys so I left early."<s>
