Sarah looked up high.<s>
She could see the scissors up on top of the cabinet.<s>
If she could only reach them, she could cut the gum out of her baby sister's hair and her mom would never know.<s>
Her mom was still busy helping her brother take out the trash.<s>
Sarah quickly pushed a chair over to the cabinet.<s>
She climbed up on the chair and got the scissors.<s>
Then she hopped down and put the chair back at the table.<s>
Sarah ran to the bathroom and shut the door.<s>
While her sister sat on the floor, Sarah cut the gum and a big piece of Sally's hair, and then threw it into the trash.<s>
Sarah put on her dress, then she and Sally headed back to the kitchen for breakfast.<s>
Sarah had taken a drink of her chocolate milk when she heard her brother Kyle start to laugh and point at Sally's head.<s>
Their mother heard the laugh and turned around to see what was so funny.<s>
Sarah began to turn red before their mother even asked what had happened.<s>
"I did it," Sarah said in a quiet voice, "I'm sorry, Mom."<s>
