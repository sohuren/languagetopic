The First Day  Seven year old Roberto grabbed his mother's hand as they entered the school.<s>
It was his first day at the new school and he was afraid.<s>
This school was bigger than the one he went to before, and there were so many kids everywhere.<s>
Still, Roberto wondered if he would make any friends here.<s>
He was always a little shy, and the few friends he had were now far away in another city.<s>
"Here we are," Roberto's mother said as she looked at a classroom door.<s>
"Room 118.<s>
This is your new classroom, Roberto.<s>
Let's go meet your new teacher."<s>
They entered the classroom and walked over to the teacher, who was writing on the blackboard.<s>
"Hello.<s>
I'm Mrs. Cruz," Roberto's mother said as she greeted the teacher with a smile.<s>
The teacher looked up and smiled at Mrs. Cruz and said, "I'm Miss Washington.<s>
It's nice to meet you Mrs. Cruz."<s>
Then she looked at Roberto and said, "Hello.<s>
And who is this nice young man?"<s>
"This is my son, Roberto.<s>
He started at this school today, and is in your class," Mrs. Cruz said as she smiled had put her hand on her son's head.<s>
"Well Roberto, class is about to begin and then you can meet all the nice children here," said Miss Washington.<s>
"Say goodbye to your mommy and then we can get started."<s>
Roberto gave his mother a big kiss and waved goodbye as she left the classroom.<s>
Then the teacher took him to his seat at his new desk.<s>
Everything went well on that first school day.<s>
Roberto made twelve new friends.<s>
He ate a good lunch had a banana and popcorn for snacks.<s>
Later that afternoon when school was finished, Roberto's mother came and took him home.<s>
