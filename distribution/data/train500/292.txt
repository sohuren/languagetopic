Once there was a young girl named Angel.<s>
Angel was very nervous because she was about to give a speech for school.<s>
The student that gave the best speech would win free tickets to see the fireworks.<s>
Angel had spent a lot of time practicing her speech because she really wanted to win.<s>
She practiced in front of her cousin, Noah.<s>
She practiced in front of her stuffed tiger, Kitten.<s>
She practiced saying her speech as she stood on one leg and looked at the ceiling.<s>
She even practiced burping her speech!<s>
Despite all that practice, Angel was still very nervous.<s>
So many other kids were giving speeches that day and they all were going to try their best!<s>
As Angel was walking in to the school she saw a penny on the ground.<s>
Her mother had always told her that pennies were lucky so she picked it up.<s>
With the penny in her hand she felt less nervous.<s>
It was her new lucky coin.<s>
When Angel's turn came she gave her speech.<s>
She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times.<s>
Her hard work and her lucky coin worked.<s>
She won the free fireworks tickets!<s>
Angel's teacher, Mr. Coffee, was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace.<s>
Angel wore it everywhere she went from then on.<s>
The fireworks were pretty cool too.<s>
