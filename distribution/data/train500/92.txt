Tuesdays during the summer tickets are buy one get one free at the city zoo.<s>
Jason loves animals, so his dad takes him to the zoo every Tuesday in the summer.<s>
This Tuesday Jason's dad is feeling sick so his mommy has to take him to the zoo.<s>
There is also a new animal that Jason can't wait to see; a rattle snake.<s>
Tuesday morning Jason's mommy wakes him up, and they get in the car to drive to the zoo.<s>
On the car ride Jason's favorite song "The Wheels on the Bus" plays on the radio.<s>
Jason's mommy turns the radio louder and they sing the song together.<s>
When they get to the zoo they go straight to the rattle snake cage, but when they get there they don't see any rattle snakes.<s>
They look around for a little bit, and all they see are some eggs.<s>
A man who works at the zoo tells them that the rattle snake must be sleeping and that it hides when it sleeps.<s>
Jason is sad because he might not get to see the rattle snake today.<s>
They walk away from the rattle snake cage and Jason's mommy buys Jason an ice cream cone to cheer him up.<s>
After walking around the zoo and seeing other animals like a bear and a monkey, Jason wants to check the rattle snake cage one more time.<s>
They get to the cage and to Jason's surprise the rattle snake is awake and moving around.<s>
Not only does he get to see the snake, but a baby is being born from one of the eggs too.<s>
Jason is very happy and excited about what he saw in the rattle snake cage and can't wait to get home and tell his dad.<s>
