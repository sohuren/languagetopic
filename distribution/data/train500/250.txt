Once upon a time there were a zebra and a monkey in a zoo.<s>
The zebra and the monkey had many napkins.<s>
What did the zebra and the monkey do with all the napkins?<s>
They didn't know.<s>
They ate the napkins.<s>
The zebra felt good.<s>
The monkey got a stomach ache.<s>
Why did the monkey get a stomach ache?<s>
The napkins were make out of straw.<s>
Straw is good for zebras.<s>
Straw is not good for monkeys.<s>
The monkey did not like eating the napkins.<s>
The zoo worker came and gave the monkey a pill.<s>
The pill made the monkey feel better.<s>
Now the monkey does not eat napkins.<s>
The monkey eats bananas instead of napkins.<s>
Now the monkey is always happy and feels good.<s>
The zebra does not like to eat bananas.<s>
The zebra eats all the napkins and feels good.<s>
The zebra and the monkey are both very happy.<s>
