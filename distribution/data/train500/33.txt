Joey felt the very first rain drop hit his hat.<s>
"Let's go inside!"<s>
he said to his friend Billy.<s>
The two ran inside the house as it began to rain more outside.<s>
Joey's mother was very happy that they missed the rain and got inside before it made a big mess.<s>
Joey and Billy weren't as happy.<s>
"What are we going to do in here all day?"<s>
asked Billy.<s>
"I don't know" said Joey, looking out the window as the rain came down.<s>
Harder.<s>
And harder.<s>
"Oh no!<s>
I left my baseball glove outside" said Joey as he watched it begin to fill up with rain.<s>
His glove was going to be a mess!<s>
Thankfully, Joey's dad pulled up in his car.<s>
Seeing the glove on the ground, he picked it up as he ran inside.<s>
"Careful sport, you almost lost this" he told his son as he tossed him the wet mitt.<s>
But Joey wasn't listening, he was looking past his dad as he walked through the door.<s>
The sky was clearing up!<s>
Joey ran outside, Billy came after him.<s>
"Look at that!"<s>
Billy said as he pointed at the sky.<s>
A rainbow was appearing, it was so beautiful!<s>
The rain wasn't bad after all!<s>
