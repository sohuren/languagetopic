The day was dark and stormy; puddles could be seen all over the ground, making the yard look like a tiny pond.<s>
Conner frowned as he let the curtain drop back down.<s>
There was no way that mommy was going to let him go out and play today.<s>
She would say that it was too muddy and he would get wet.<s>
Conner thought to himself, "But what if I don't ask her?"<s>
Smiling, Conner pushed open the sliding door to the back yard.<s>
Slipping on his rain boots, he rushed outside and began to run and jump from puddle to puddle, sending large showers of water up around him with every jump.<s>
After he had jumped in all of the puddles he looked back towards the house to find mommy standing in the doorway watching him with a smile on her face.<s>
She giggled as she too pulled on her rain boots and joined him in jumping from puddle to puddle.<s>
