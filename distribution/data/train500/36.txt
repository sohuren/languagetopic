Luke was starting his first day of day care.<s>
He was a little nervous about meeting his new teacher and all of his new friends.<s>
When his mother dropped him off, he kissed her goodbye and sat down in the green seat that his teacher showed him.<s>
He looked around the room.<s>
There were a lot of other kids there.<s>
A baby sat in a high chair sucking on a blue pacifier.<s>
A kid about Luke's age named George was drawing and tracing his hand on paper.<s>
A little girl named Mary raised her hand and asked the teacher if she could go to the toilet.<s>
The teacher walked her into the bathroom and then returned to the class.<s>
She started helping Luke get to know the other kids in the class.<s>
A little girl named Jessica tapped Luke on the shoulder and gave him some candy.<s>
He took the pink candy from her and thanked her.<s>
Luke smiled and thought, "I'm going to like it here."<s>
