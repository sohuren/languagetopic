Thomas looked up at the clock hanging on the wall of his room.<s>
He could not wait for his friend Ben to come over today.<s>
It was the weekend, so Thomas's dad had no work the next day.<s>
This meant his father would take them sledding.<s>
This was one of Thomas' favorite winter activities, even if he always got a few bumps and scrapes along the way.<s>
Thomas heard a knocking noise downstairs and knew it was Ben at the door.<s>
He got excited.<s>
This meant they would be sledding soon.<s>
He grabbed another mouthful of one of his mother's famous sugar cookies and made his way downstairs, tripping on his shoes.<s>
He opened the door to see Ben's mom giving him a friendly smile down the walk.<s>
Ben let himself in and his mother waved goodbye to them both.<s>
Thomas asked Ben if he wanted a cup of hot chocolate and then he went to find his dad for some sledding action.<s>
Both Ben and Thomas were very happy.<s>
They got their gloves on and made their way out to the garage to wait for Thomas' dad.<s>
Thomas dad would be driving them the long distance to the park.<s>
