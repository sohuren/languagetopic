Once there was a dog named Noodle.<s>
Noodle had two brothers named Puff and Fluff, and a sister named Polly.<s>
Noodle's best friend was a boy named Jack.<s>
Jack went to school, but the dogs stayed home all day.<s>
Jack liked to feed Noodle chicken and beef.<s>
One day Jack went to the store and bought chicken for Noodle.<s>
Jack put too much chicken in Noodle's bowl.<s>
Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt.<s>
Poor Noodle!<s>
Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick.<s>
Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play.<s>
Polly stayed home because she was sick.<s>
There were so many things to see at the park.<s>
Puff found a little red ladybug.<s>
Fluff found a big gray mouse.<s>
Noodle found a long brown stick.<s>
Jack found a deep pond with three ducks in it.<s>
Everyone had a great day at the park.<s>
Then the three dogs and Jack all went back home.<s>
When they got home, Polly was asleep on the bed.<s>
Polly said she was feeling better.<s>
Jack brought Polly some chicken noodle soup to eat.<s>
Noodle, Puff, and Fluff sat on the bed with Polly eating bones and drinking milk.<s>
