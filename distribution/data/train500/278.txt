When he opened the door and entered the house, he heard a lot of people yell, "Surprise!"<s>
It was a surprise party for his birthday.<s>
His parents called all his friends' parents and invited them to come to a party for Tony.<s>

It was really a surprise to him.<s>
His best friends Jim and Melissa were there.<s>
Martha and Phil were there, too.<s>
There were about 20 kids at the party, and some of their parents were there, too.<s>
After a few hours, Tony started to open his presents.<s>
He got a new shirt, a basketball, and a book about dinosaurs.<s>
Finally, he opened the last present, which was from his parents.<s>
It was a blue bicycle.<s>
