The witch wanted to stop making poisons in her big pot.<s>
She wanted to be a cook instead.<s>
She could make all sorts of treats, like blueberry sandwiches, orange pizzas, and grape pie.<s>
Her best treat she made was strawberry eggs.<s>
She wanted the people from town to invite her to parties.<s>
She wanted them to ask her to cook for them.<s>
Most of all, she wanted them to be friends with her.<s>
Her plan was to get them to try her strawberry eggs.<s>
They were shaped like eggs but when you would chew on them they tasted like strawberries.<s>
They also had medicine in them so they would help people too.<s>
They were delicious.<s>
Finally the big day came.<s>
The witch brought her cart into the town.<s>
She was late to town because she got lost.<s>
Then her wagon broke and she had to fix its wheel.<s>
It was full of the strawberry eggs.<s>
The witch started handed them out.<s>
At first people were nervous.<s>
They did not know the witch well.<s>
They knew she was the witch who lived in the woods, all alone.<s>
They knew she had made poisons.<s>
But once the sheriff tried them, everyone started trying them.<s>
After everyone in town had one, they put the witch on their shoulders and cheered for her, even the town's baker.<s>
Finally the town's leader asked the witch if she would move into the town.<s>
The witch happily said yes and they all had as many strawberry eggs as they could ever want.<s>
