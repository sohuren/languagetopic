A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell.<s>
He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals.<s>
He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream.<s>
Rabbits don't like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster.<s>
And he didn't really like to snack on melons either.<s>
He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers.<s>
He could smell the flowers from a long way away.<s>
He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster.<s>
One hop, two hops, three hops.<s>
On his third hop he always bounced a little higher.<s>
He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster.<s>
The flowers were in sight.<s>
He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before.<s>
A wonderful smell at last.<s>
