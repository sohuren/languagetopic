Janet walked past the barn, the big tree, and through the back yard to reach the chicken pen.<s>
Janet gathered the eggs from the chicken pen, so that her father could make scrambled eggs for breakfast.<s>
He would need at least 5 eggs for the meal, two for Janet and three for himself.<s>
Janet could only find four eggs in the chicken pen.<s>
She looked under every chicken, and in every nest, but could not find another egg.<s>
She placed the four eggs in her basket, and began to walk toward the house, when she heard a quacking sound.<s>
She went toward the sound and found a nest near the pond, with large brown eggs inside.<s>
"Quack" said a nearby duck, as Janet took an egg from the nest.<s>
Now she had enough for breakfast.<s>
