Emily was a princess that lived in a castle made out of rainbows and chocolate.<s>
Her mom and dad were very kind to her.<s>
Her favorite thing to do was to play on the swings on the chocolate tree in their front yard with her friend Daisy.<s>
Emily always got first turn on the swings, and Daisy always pushed her, until it was Daisy's turn, and Emily would push Daisy.<s>
One day, Daisy said that she wasn't going to push Emily on the swings if Daisy didn't get to swing first.<s>
This made Emily very mad.<s>
Her turn was always first, and Emily thought that it wasn't fair that Daisy wasn't going to push her if she didn't get to swing first.<s>
So she ran into the castle to tell her mom and dad the Queen and King.<s>
The Queen and King listened to Emily's story, and they told Emily that it was Daisy's turn.<s>
"What?"<s>
said Emily.<s>
She was so mad!<s>
Emily always got the first turn!<s>
"It's only fair to Daisy, Emily."<s>
said her mom.<s>
"Now go out there and push your friend on the swing."<s>
Emily went outside and pushed Daisy on the swing.<s>
After Emily pushed Daisy, Daisy pushed Emily, and Emily came inside still upset.<s>
"Why did you make me push her on the swing first?"<s>
said Emily.<s>
"Because that's how you keep friends, sweetie."<s>
said her mom the Queen.<s>
"If I were Daisy and I never got to get a turn first, I don't think I'd want to be friends."<s>
"Okay, I think I understand that."<s>
said Emily.<s>
From then on, Emily and Daisy took turns being first on the swing, and they were friends for the rest of their lives.<s>
