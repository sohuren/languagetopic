Maria was a teacher at a small school in Arizona.<s>
Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job.<s>
When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly.<s>
The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher.<s>
In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone.<s>
Nothing else came with the house.<s>
So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend.<s>
So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house.<s>
First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table.<s>
Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom.<s>
Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room.<s>
When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices.<s>
She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black.<s>
She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown.<s>
Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red.<s>
Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive.<s>
Maria then had to choose if she wanted them to deliver her couch or if she would pick it up.<s>
Knowing she had only a small car she went with the deliver choice.<s>
She also had to choose if she wanted them to set up the couch for her or for her to set it up herself.<s>
She went with them setting it up since they would be there to deliver it anyway.<s>
Maria loved her new house and job.<s>
