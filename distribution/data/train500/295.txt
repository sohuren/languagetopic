Larry the dinosaur was going to go to a dinosaur birthday party that night, and he was very excited, because the party was for him!<s>
He was turning 7 years old, which in dinosaur years, that means he was going to be an adult!<s>
There were so many different things he was going to do!<s>
He knew that there was going to be a moon bounce, and that he was going to get a lot of presents from all of his dinosaur friends, but the thing that he was most excited about, was the cake!<s>
Larry's favorite food was cake, and he hoped that they got the right flavor.<s>
Larry's favorite flavor was banana.<s>
Larry went to school that day and everyone told him happy birthday!<s>
When he came home from school, all the lights were out.<s>
"Hello?"<s>
Larry said, as he came into the house.<s>
All of the sudden, the lights went on, and there was everyone!<s>
"Happy birthday Larry!"<s>
all of his friends shouted.<s>
Confetti went everywhere.<s>
"Where is the cake?"<s>
he asked.<s>
"Here it is!"<s>
said his mom, and brought out the cake.<s>
"It's a chocolate cake, like you wanted!"<s>
Larry froze.<s>
"I said that I wanted a banana cake."<s>
said Larry.<s>
He was very sad.<s>
"Now the party is going to be no fun."<s>
"Oh Larry."<s>
said his mom.<s>
"Your friends are here, and we worked very hard to set up this party for you!<s>
Please at least go spend some time with your friends."<s>
Larry was sad, but he tried to have fun.<s>
And the more he tried to have fun, the more he liked the party.<s>
The moon bounce was fun, and the gifts were very nice.<s>
He found out that you can still have fun even when things don't go as planned.<s>
