Timmy had the best grandmother ever.<s>
She was very nice because she would always help Timmy when he needed help with his homework.<s>
She would sit down with Timmy in the kitchen and help him with his spelling every night.<s>
Then she would go back to the living room and watch television when he worked on his math.<s>
After that she would cook Timmy a big dinner, and they would both eat it together before Timmy's mom and dad came to pick him up.<s>
When Timmy went home he would sometimes call his grandmother to say hello.<s>
Even when she was sleepy she would talk with him and tell him a bedtime story.<s>
One time she even told him a story about his grandfather who had been a farmer.<s>
Timmy loved this story because he never got to meet his grandfather.<s>
One day he wanted to be like him and be a farmer.<s>
