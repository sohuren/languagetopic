Max was sitting at home reading his favorite book.<s>
The story was about cakes.<s>
Max thought to himself, "I am going to go to the store and get stuff to make a cake!"<s>
Max headed to the grocery store to get the cake ingredients.<s>
Max was going to make a banana and chocolate cake.<s>
On his way he saw his friend Greg, a small wolf.<s>
Greg was also heading to the store.<s>
Greg was going to make a pie for his mother.<s>
He needed to get strawberries and blueberries.<s>
Max asked Greg if he wanted to walk to the store together.<s>
Greg the wolf said yes, so they walked to the store together.<s>
At the store the other people looked at Max and Greg.<s>
They had never seen an alligator and a wolf who are friends before.<s>
Max and Greg laughed at this.<s>
Max got the chocolate and bananas to make his cake and Greg got the strawberries and blueberries to make his pie.<s>
They left the store.<s>
Max waved good bye to Greg.<s>
"See you later alligator," said Greg.<s>
Max went home and made his cake, it was very good.<s>
