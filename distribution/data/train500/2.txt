Billy was like a king on the school yard.<s>
A king without a queen.<s>
He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess.<s>
He was a big bully.<s>
He told kids what to do, what to play, what to sing, and called them names like "Dork".<s>
He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his "kingdom".<s>
All of the other kids were scared of him.<s>
Even I was scared of him.<s>
He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry.<s>
Last week, a very, very stupid kid chose not to listen to Billy.<s>
Billy beat him up and Mr.Stupid Kid told the grownups that he tripped.<s>
No one would dare get Billy in trouble.<s>
Billy was mean, but he kept the school yard from getting too crazy.<s>
Well I had enough it.<s>
Billy had been picking on us for too long and we had to stop him.<s>
I grabbed some fishing line from home and brought it to school the next day.<s>
Before recess, I tied a long piece of fishing line around the tree by Billy's bench and tied the other end to a big rock.<s>
Then I went inside for class.<s>
When it was recess, Billy sat on his bench and started yelling at people.<s>
This was it.<s>
I called out, "Hey you big dummy!<s>
You're not so tough".<s>
Billy's face turned red with anger and he started marching my way.<s>
Billy marched and then tripped over the fishing line.<s>
Billy was lying face down and he seemed to be crying.<s>
Everyone cheered.<s>
The king was down.<s>
