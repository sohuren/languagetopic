Charles went on a bike ride last week when he was on vacation.<s>
His father took him Saturday morning.<s>
It had rained Thursday and Friday.<s>
They got in his father's truck and put their bikes in the back.<s>
Father and son went to a bike path in a town near them.<s>
Trees were on both sides of the path.<s>
It was nice and warm outside, but Charles like riding on the road between the trees.<s>
There was a lot of shade.<s>
Charles saw several friends and people from school when they were riding.<s>
He got to ride with Harry and Peter.<s>
They also rode with Peter's sisters, Anne, Kelley, and Beth.<s>
His friend Paul also went by.<s>
They only said, "Hi," to each other.<s>
Charles fell once.<s>
He fell after seeing a girl he liked.<s>
Her name was Claire.<s>
She came over to see if he was okay.<s>
He had a small cut on his arm.<s>
His father put a bandage on his arm and they rode back to the truck.<s>
Charles and his father stopped for ice cream.<s>
They both got sundaes and ate them when they got home.<s>
They were glad they went for a ride because it also rained on Sunday.<s>
