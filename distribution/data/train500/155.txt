Ms. Strawberry loved to make vanilla cupcakes!<s>
Everyone loved her cupcakes, and she loved making them, too.<s>
One morning, she was in the store, buying ingredients for her  cupcakes, when she came across the most delicious looking chocolate frosting she had ever seen in her life!<s>
She bought a whole bunch, excited about how delicious her cupcakes would be for her cupcake party tonight!<s>
She went home and took extra care making her cupcakes that afternoon.<s>
She made them extra fluffy, sweet and delicious.<s>
She even pulled out her favorite sprinkles for her cupcakes, bright purple ones, which was her favorite color.<s>
She couldn't believe how amazing her cupcakes were going to be for the cupcake party!<s>
That night at the cupcake party, Ms. Strawberry showed everyone her plate of delicious cupcakes!<s>
So many of her friends were there for the party.<s>
There was Mrs. Apple, Mr. Banana, Ms. Mitten, Mr. Green and even quiet Mr. Lemon showed up.<s>
Everyone was very happy about her cupcakes!<s>
Everyone except Mr. Lemon.<s>
Mr. Lemon took one bite of that cupcake and said, "Eew!<s>
This is the worst cupcake in the world!"<s>
Ms. Strawberry didn't know what to say!<s>
Were they really the worst cupcakes in the world?<s>
She had tried so hard!<s>
Ms. Strawberry started to cry.<s>
"Why don't you like my cupcakes, Mr. Lemon?<s>
I worked so hard to make the extra delicious!"<s>
Mr. Lemon said, "I don't like vanilla, and I don't like chocolate!"<s>
Ms. Strawberry cried even more!<s>
"There, there," said Mrs. Apple, and patted Ms. Strawberry on the head.<s>
"It's okay.<s>
Not everyone is going to like your cupcakes!<s>
You only have to know that you worked hard and that they're still tasty!"<s>
With that, Ms. Strawberry stopped crying, and she and Mr. Lemon made up.<s>
