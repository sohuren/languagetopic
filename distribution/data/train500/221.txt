Hannah was so sad!<s>
If she had one wish, it would be that she was well enough to go outside and play.<s>
The storm last night had brought a lot of snow, she could see it through the window.<s>
The snow caused everything to twinkle and shine, like it was colored with a marker made of glitter.<s>
What a way to start Christmas break, with the flu making her stuck on the sofa under a blanket.<s>
Hannah's brother was getting ready to go outside and enjoy the snow.<s>
He put on his jacket and put her hat on his head.<s>
He had to wiggle his gloves out of his pocket, but he was nice and warm.<s>
From the sofa, Hannah watched her brother play in the snow with his friends and throw snowballs.<s>
Her brother tossed a stone at the pond and it broke through the ice with a splash.<s>
