Terry is a normal human boy who enjoys football and playing with his toys.<s>
What makes him different is that he really enjoys talking to his magical reindeer Max.<s>
One day, Terry is walking around town with Max, and as they pass by the nearby farm, the farmer who owns the land calls out to them - "Hey!<s>
You, over there!"<s>
They quickly turn around, not sure if they are the ones being called to, but seeing no one nearby, they walk over to the farmer.<s>
"What do you need, sir?"<s>
Terry asks.<s>
"I need help with the plants; they're growing faster than normal.<s>
Can you help with the potato plants?"<s>
the farmer asks.<s>
"Sure!<s>
Let's help out, Max!"<s>
Terry happily answers.<s>
They end up spending the rest of the day helping, and are paid well, both in potatoes, carrots and money, for their work.<s>
"That was fun!"<s>
Terry says to Max, as they head home.<s>
Max simple nods back, as they hurry back to their home.<s>
