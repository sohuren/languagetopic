Andrew waited for his granddaddy to show up.<s>
They were going fishing.<s>
His mom had packed them a lunch.<s>
She had made Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches.<s>
She also packed a bottle of nice cool water to drink.<s>
Andrew had wanted something else for lunch.<s>
He wanted chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf, but his mom sent Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches.<s>
The best way to get to the river was along the path.<s>
When the path ended, they needed to go through the bushes to the river.<s>
On some days they would think about going another way.<s>
They could go over the bridge, or through the back of the house or through Uncle Tom's yard.<s>
Today they took the path to the river.<s>
Andrew found some animal poop along the path.<s>
He asked his Grandpa what kind of animal poop he had found.<s>
He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop.<s>
Grandpa pointed in the bushes.<s>
Andrew saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes.<s>
Andrew knew that he had was looking at a raccoon.<s>
He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop.<s>
When Andrew and Grandpa got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water.<s>
Andrew caught his first fish right away.<s>
He caught a second fish before lunch.<s>
He got hungry and had his Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich and cool water.<s>
He saw that Grandpa had fallen asleep.<s>
After eating his lunch, Andrew caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa.<s>
When Andrew and Grandpa got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to Andrew's mother, so she could make a good dinner.<s>
