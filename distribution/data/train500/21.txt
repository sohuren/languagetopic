One day, my family took a vacation to the beach.<s>
We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours!<s>
We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost.<s>
My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat.<s>
My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver.<s>
My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games.<s>
I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick.<s>
My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove.<s>
The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too!<s>
We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed.<s>
We were so tired from doing nothing all day!<s>
The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals!<s>
We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish!<s>
We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not.<s>
When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch.<s>
I was very happy and had a great vacation!<s>
