On the third day of November, Ron and Pam went to the store.<s>
They wanted to get some food for a new recipe.<s>
It was late in the afternoon, but they wanted to eat the food soon at dinner.<s>
To save time they split the list in half.<s>
Ron was to get the pasta and tomato sauce, and Pam was to get the vegetables and juice.<s>
They went their separate ways in the store, and made plans to meet in the checkout line in half an hour.<s>
On her way to the fruit and vegetable section, Pam ran into her friend Tom.<s>
Tom had bought a pet bunny for his friend and wanted to buy it some food.<s>
He asked Pam what he needs to feed the bunny.<s>
Pam told him lettuce and carrots, so he put 5 heads of lettuce in his basket along with one bag of carrots.<s>
Tom said goodbye to Pam and went to the front of the store to buy his vegetables.<s>
Now it was time for Pam to pick out the vegetables she would buy for dinner.<s>
She wanted to make a salad, so she bought spinach, 2 big red tomatoes, a box of mushrooms, and 3 cucumbers.<s>
Pam then went to where they kept the juice and grabbed a big bottle of lemonade.<s>
Pam went to the front of the store and met Ron.<s>
They handed their items to the sales clerk so that they could buy them.<s>
The total cost of the food was 20 dollars.<s>
As a gift to Pam, Ron paid for the food and said happy birthday.<s>
As a gift he would be cooking her dinner.<s>
