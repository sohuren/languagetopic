Today is the big day, today is Saturday and it is my birthday party.<s>
I turned 7 on Thursday, but I wanted my party on the weekend.<s>
All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.<s>
We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!<s>
The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.<s>
Bob made us all laugh a lot.<s>
After the clown left we all played fun games.<s>
We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.<s>
There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.<s>
My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.<s>
After that, my mom came out with my cake.<s>
It was chocolate with chocolate icing!<s>
Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too.<s>
We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could.<s>
I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.<s>
My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.<s>
It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.<s>
After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.<s>
Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.<s>
My birthday party was the best day of my life.<s>
