Once there was a girl named Ruth, who loved to play outside whenever she could.<s>
One day, she was running around outside with a friend, but she tripped and scraped her knee very badly.<s>
She doubled over in pain, screaming for her father "DADDY!!!"<s>
she yelled, until he ran outside to help.<s>
"Thank goodness that only the skin on your knee was hurt!"<s>
he said, as he picked her up to bring her inside.<s>
"We need to cover your cut, and it looks like it was about to start raining anyway," he said.<s>
He brought her into the restroom, so he could wash the cut, then put on medicine and a large bandage.<s>
"That medicine hurt..." Ruth said, but her cut was feeling better than it did before.<s>
"Well, at least now you don't have to worry about it getting worse," her father said.<s>
"Hopefully it won't take long for your cut to get better, then you can go back to playing outside again - be careful from now on!"<s>
