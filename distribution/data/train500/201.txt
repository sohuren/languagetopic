One day the Smith family went to the zoo.<s>
Ann Smith rode her bike from place to place.<s>
Joe Smith crawled everywhere he went.<s>
Their parents, Katie and Mike Smith, walked.<s>
After visiting many animals they all met up at the monkey cage.<s>
There was a long line to feed the monkeys.<s>
The line was so long that Joe fell asleep for a bit.<s>
Finally, it was time for the Smith family to feed the monkeys.<s>
The daughter, Ann, feed the monkeys a banana.<s>
The son, Joe, fed the monkeys a cracker.<s>
The mother, Katie, fed the monkeys a piece of cheese.<s>
The father, Mike, fed the monkeys an apple.<s>
After the monkeys were done eating the zoo worker told them to pick their favorite treat, and give the person who gave it to them a hug.<s>
The monkeys all hugged Joe.<s>
Joe's parents were proud of him for picking the treat he liked best.<s>
As a reward, they gave him a special prize.<s>
Joe got the bike he had always wished for.<s>
At the end of the day he left the zoo a very happy child.<s>
