It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land.<s>
It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy.<s>
She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family.<s>
She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking.<s>
A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies.<s>
She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour.<s>
She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour.<s>
While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk.<s>
She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner.<s>
At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies.<s>
After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello.<s>
She went home after, and made her yummy pies.<s>
