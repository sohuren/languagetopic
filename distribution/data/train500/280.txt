Kelsey's uncle Jack gave him and his brother, Davy, some chalk to play with.<s>
Kelsey was a pretty good artist.<s>
His family said that all of his drawings looked real.<s>
His brother was sad that he was not as good at art and drawing as Kelsey.<s>
Davy teased Kelsey to take his mind off the fact that he was not as good at art.<s>
He called Kelsey names and pretended to be a monster to scare Kelsey when he wasn't paying attention.<s>
When their mother gave them some chocolate as a treat, Davy took all of it and wouldn't let Kelsey have any.<s>
Uncle Jack finally saw that Davy was hurting his brother, so he sat down to talk to him.<s>
After lots of questioning, Davy told his uncle the truth.<s>
"Instead of teasing your brother," Uncle Jack said, "why don't you ask him to teach you how to draw some things?<s>
He's used to his big brother knowing everything.<s>
I think he would like to teach you some things."<s>
Davy looked at the ground and finally said, "Okay."<s>
Kelsey was pleased that his brother asked him to teach him.<s>
After that, both boys got along much better.<s>
