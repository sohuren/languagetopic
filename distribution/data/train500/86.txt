One day, a boy named Jack wanted take a trip on his red tricycle.<s>
He was not sure where he wanted to go, but he knew he wanted to go somewhere far away.<s>
It was a cloudy and chilly day, so Jack wore a warm shirt.<s>
Jack worried that he might get lonely on his trip.<s>
He borrowed his mother's phone and taped it to the handle bars of his tricycle so he could call home.<s>
He also put his music player in his pocket.<s>
Jack put some left over pizza in his backpack in case he got hungry.<s>
Jack pedaled down his driveway, heading out on his big trip.<s>
When he got to the end of his driveway, Mrs. Jones, his teacher from school, was walking by on the sidewalk.<s>
"Hello Jack", said Mrs. Jones, "Where are you going on that nice red tricycle?"<s>
"I'm going on a trip to someplace far away" said Jack.<s>
Mrs. Jones smiled, and thought for a second.<s>
"Make sure you are back by morning, we have a field trip tomorrow", said Mrs. Jones.<s>
Jack had been waiting for the field trip for weeks.<s>
He looked at Mrs. Jones and said, "I think I'll wait to take a trip until I can fly.<s>
I don't want to miss the field trip and this tricycle is not very fast."<s>
