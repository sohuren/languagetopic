In a zoo, many animals have claws: birds, dogs and lions.<s>
Even some monkeys have claws!<s>
One summer day, the eyes of many visitors were facing the lion cage.<s>
It was like the famous movie "The Lion King".<s>
One lion cub had been born and was drinking from its mother.<s>
There was a straw bed for the lions to sleep on, and all visitors loved to watch the baby lion cub.<s>
Well, a monkey (with claws) came into the lion's cage all of a sudden!<s>
But the lions weren't afraid, because they are kings of the animal world.<s>
Also, they had seen the movie and knew what the monkeys wanted.<s>
So it happened that the monkey took the cub from its mother into its hands.<s>
It walked over to the gate by the visitors and held up the cub for all to see!<s>
People cried.<s>
People took pictures.<s>
They were seeing the real-life 'Lion King'!<s>
