I once was walking in the woods with my friends.<s>
The day was very nice, there were a lot of trees.<s>
The walk was part of a week long trip I took with Boy Scouts.<s>
This day was day number three of our trip.<s>
There was four of us walking.<s>
We were walking down a path when all of the sudden we came across a bear.<s>
This scared us.<s>
Bears can be dangerous.<s>
A few seconds later we saw another bear, there was not only one.<s>
This bear was a baby bear.<s>
A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous.<s>
We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear.<s>
The leader told us not to walk towards the bear.<s>
You also can not make any quick motions.<s>
The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears.<s>
After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.<s>
