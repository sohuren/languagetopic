There once was a giant orange farm in space.<s>
No human had ever been there before.<s>
It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel.<s>
The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032.<s>
They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit.<s>
In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm.<s>
On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses.<s>
Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth.<s>
Hugo was no normal man.<s>
He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air.<s>
Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours.<s>
Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit.<s>
The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume.<s>
Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space.<s>
He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges.<s>
Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets.<s>
Hugo wrote all of them down, then sneezed so hard he went back to Earth!<s>
With his help, Earth has now become the best place to grow oranges.<s>
