Susan was very happy to get some money from her grandmother.<s>
She spent all morning at her grandmother's house doing chores for her.<s>
Grandmother was getting older, and sometimes she needed help with small things around the house.<s>
The first thing that Susan did was clean the big window in her house.<s>
It was afternoon and the sun was shining, but it was hard to tell because the window was so dirty!<s>
Susan used water and soap to clean the window.<s>
It was very clean when she was finished.<s>
Next, she swept the front porch.<s>
She put all of the dirt and leaves into a big bin in the front yard.<s>
That was a lot of work.<s>
Susan was going back in the house for lunch when she saw that the light in the hall was out.<s>
She asked her grandmother to show her where the light bulbs were at so that she could change it.<s>
Since she was so short she had to get a stool to stand on.<s>
Her grandmother stood by to make sure she didn't fall.<s>
This was her last job of the day.<s>
After all of her hard work her grandmother made her a ham sandwich with no cheese.<s>
Susan did not like cheese.<s>
Then her grandmother gave her five dollars for helping.<s>
This was a whole dollar more than she got the last time!<s>
