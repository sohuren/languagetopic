The stinker was that no one let the elf in.<s>
He had waited at the door for four whole hours, but was afraid to knock in case the noise would wake the humans.<s>
This elf was the tooth fairy's helper, but one day hoped to work in the North Pole.<s>
That would never happen if he couldn't even help the tooth fairy with teeth on his first day working for her.<s>
It was almost morning now.<s>
Soon the children would wake up and run out the front door with their books for school.<s>
Inside, the tooth fairy would be wondering what was keeping him.<s>
"It's too dangerous to stay at this door," the elf thought, "The children might see me."<s>
Just then he heard the alarm clocks go off inside.<s>
He dove into a nearby bush and hid, hoping that his green uniform would help him match the color of the bush's leaves.<s>
