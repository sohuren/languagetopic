Once upon a time there was a cowgirl named Callie.<s>
Callie was the most beautiful cowgirl in all the land.<s>
She rode a beautiful horse.<s>
Her horse was brown.<s>
There are plenty of other horses.<s>
There are black horses, white horses, and red horses, but Callie's brown horse was the only horse in the world.<s>
Callie lived in a beautiful house with her husband.<s>
Her husband's name was Henry.<s>
Henry was a very good farmer.<s>
He grew tomatoes.<s>
His neighbor grew corn, potatoes, and bananas.<s>
His neighbor's name was David.<s>
David had a son named James who played in Henry's field.<s>
One day James fell and Henry almost ran him over with his horse.<s>
It was very scary.<s>
James was very careful when playing in the field.<s>
His dad told him never to play in the field again and he listened.<s>
Henry was very sorry for scaring him and sent him a basket of tomatoes.<s>
