Seedy the watermelon was a very special type of watermelon.<s>
He didn't have any seeds.<s>
He was green and he had stripes.<s>
All of his cousins had seeds, but he didn't have any.<s>
He felt very left out.<s>
He couldn't thing of why he was different.<s>
His mom told him it was because he was a very special watermelon.<s>
She also tells him she loves him the way he is.<s>
But Seedy didn't think it was a good thing.<s>
He wished he could be like everyone else and have seeds.<s>
One day, he rolled out to the lawn and looked at all of his new cousins growing in the garden.<s>
He rolled around until he found a little baby watermelon that didn't have any seeds either.<s>
He sat next to him and talked to him.<s>
He told him that he was very special, and was excited for him to be picked off the vine and be his special best friend.<s>
He would name him Seedy, Jr.<s>
