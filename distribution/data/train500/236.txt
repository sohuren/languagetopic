There was a beautiful butterfly that was flying around in a park.<s>
It was the only one in there.<s>
It was pink.<s>
It was very pretty.<s>
A small boy saw it and wanted to put it in his pocket.<s>
He had a naughty look on his face.<s>
First he walked slowly to where the butterfly was.<s>
The butterfly had been sitting by a flower.<s>
When it saw the boy nearby, it started to fly away.<s>
The boy quickly started to chase it.<s>
He laughed as he ran.<s>
It was a game for him.<s>
The butterfly was scared.<s>
It flew very fast and very high in the air.<s>
The boy jumped up.<s>
The butterfly would not stay still.<s>
He jumped as far up as he could.<s>
He tried many, many times but he could not reach the butterfly.<s>
The butterfly flew away.<s>
The boy could not catch the butterfly.<s>
He left the park with a sad look on his face.<s>
He wanted to cry but did not.<s>
