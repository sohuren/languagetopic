There was once an old tree.<s>
The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree.<s>
The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it.<s>
Animals liked the tree as well.<s>
Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too!<s>
Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.<s>
One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down.<s>
This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad.<s>
Why was it being cut down?<s>
Was it too old?<s>
Too weak?<s>
Maybe it was dying?<s>
The children learned it was because the tree was sick.<s>
The children were very sad to hear about this.<s>
They wondered where they would play from now on.<s>
The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go.<s>
One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story.<s>
His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy.<s>
What was it?<s>
He wondered.<s>
Was a jungle gym going to be put in?<s>
A mall, maybe a park?<s>
In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.<s>
John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends.<s>
"Big news!"<s>
, he shouted.<s>
"My parents told me a new tree is going to be planted here over the old one!"<s>
All his friends cheered in excitement, now knowing they wouldn't lose their favorite spot.<s>
John and his friends went to celebrate by getting ice cream.<s>
His friends liked chocolate and vanilla but John got strawberry.<s>
