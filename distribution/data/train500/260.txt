One Saturday afternoon about the second week of May, Maggie and her mom Jan went to the dentist.<s>
Maggie was seven years old and she was scared of the dentist, but her mom promised to fix her favorite chicken dish for dinner if Maggie was a good girl.<s>
"At least it's not the doctor's!"<s>
she said.<s>
They got to the dentist office and Jan told the woman, named Tiffany, at the front desk that they were there.<s>
There were lots of toys in the waiting room but Maggie was too nervous to enjoy them like the other kids.<s>
Finally, a woman came and told Maggie and Jan that it was Maggie's turn.<s>
They made a right turn and went to the third room on the left.<s>
Maggie sat down in the dentist's chair.<s>
A woman, Mary, came in and cleaned her teeth and told Maggie and Jan that Maggie had done well with her brushing.<s>
Then the dentist, Taylor, came in and did a checkup.<s>
He saw that everything was good and that Maggie had no problems with her teeth.<s>
He gave Maggie a bag with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a sugar free candy.<s>
There was also a smiley face sticker in the bag.<s>
Jan was proud of her daughter and stopped at the grocery store to get ingredients for the chicken dish for dinner as promised.<s>
