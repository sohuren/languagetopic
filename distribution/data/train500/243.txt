"Hey!<s>
That isn't fair!<s>
Knights can't fly!<s>
Only wizards like me can!<s>
And maybe also witches."<s>
Bobby yelled.<s>
"Yes!<s>
They can, too!"<s>
Frank said, "They're the most powerful and you can't stop me from flying!"<s>
"Well, if you fly, then I can fight with a sword, too.<s>
It's only fair," Bobby said back.<s>
"No!<s>
They can't!<s>
They aren't even strong enough to pick up a sword.<s>
They can't even pick up a knife, they're so weak!<s>
I don't even know what you're talking about.<s>
You're crazy, aren't you?"<s>
Frank pointed his finger at Bobby and ran at him with the sword made out of cardboard.<s>
Bobby jumped out of the way as quickly as he could!<s>
Bobby then pointed a finger at Frank.<s>
"FREEZE!"<s>
Frank stopped in place.<s>
"Hey, you can't use the freeze spell.<s>
How can I fight you if I can't move?<s>
I'm going to tell mom."<s>
"I can use any spell I want!<s>
I can use Freeze, Trap, and Fly!<s>
I can do any of them!<s>
I'm also telling mom that you think you can fly and you can't.<s>
You're a stupid knight with no brains.<s>
I have all the brains here."<s>
Bobby crossed his arms over his chest and stomped a foot on the ground.<s>
"You take that back!<s>
I'm the smartest knight there is and I'll get you any day!"<s>
Suddenly, Frank pulled Bobby to the ground.<s>
"Take it back right now!"<s>
"BOYS!<s>
What's all the noise?"<s>
Mom asked.<s>
"Bobby called me stupid!"<s>
Frank yelled.<s>
"Frank is trying to fly!"<s>
Bobby cried.<s>
"Oh boy."<s>
Mom laughed.<s>
