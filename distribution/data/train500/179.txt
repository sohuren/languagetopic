Once there was a group of adventurers who went on an adventure in a place named Hyperion where there was a lot of snow.<s>
Their names were Thor, Bravos, and Pierre.<s>
Thor and Bravos were from Norway, but Pierre was from Paris, France.<s>
Because of where he was from, he wasn't used to the cold.<s>
To stay warm, Pierre wore three jackets.<s>
One day during their adventure the men saw a strange cave.<s>
Thor and Bravos wanted to go inside, but Pierre was afraid.<s>
He had heard that a horrible bug monster named Vlastos lived in the caves of Hyperion.<s>
Thor and Bravos told him that was only a fairy tale.<s>
They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave.<s>
Finally they got Pierre to go into the cave.<s>
Inside there were lots of tunnels.<s>
They chose the middle tunnel.<s>
The tunnel went down into the earth.<s>
After a long time it ended.<s>
The men were in a huge room.<s>
There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls.<s>
