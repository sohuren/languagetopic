Sam was outside playing.<s>
It was very hot out and he got really thirsty.<s>
He saw that Mr. Brown was setting up a table with sodas and snacks down the street.<s>
Sam was very excited because this would solve his problem.<s>
He checked his pockets.<s>
They were empty.<s>
Where did his money go?<s>
This was a problem.<s>
In order to get a soda and snack he would need money.<s>
Sam ran home as fast as he could.<s>
He was in a rush.<s>
He passed by Jim as he was running.<s>
He asked Sam why he was running.<s>
"No time," Sam Said.<s>
When he got inside the house Sam was very happy.<s>
His money was on his dresser in his bedroom.<s>
Thank goodness.<s>
He had enough money to get a soda.<s>
Sam ran back outside, but this time he slowed down when he saw Jim.<s>
He told Jim to come with him to Mr. Brown's table.<s>
He had enough money to buy them both a soda.<s>
