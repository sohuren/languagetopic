One day, my dog woke up early and wouldn't go back to sleep.<s>
Why did the dog wake up early?<s>
I tried really hard to find out.<s>
"Are you sick, dog?"<s>
I asked.<s>
He didn't say anything, so I took his temperature.<s>
It said he wasn't sick!<s>
"Are you hungry, dog?"<s>
He didn't say anything, so I feed him some dog food.<s>
He didn't eat it!<s>
"Are you thirsty, dog?"<s>
He didn't say anything, so I gave him some water.<s>
He didn't drink it!<s>
"What's wrong, dog?"<s>
He wagged and wagged his tail, and then went over to a bag of balloons that I had.<s>
He poked them with his nose.<s>
"Oh!"<s>
I said.<s>
I went over to the balloons and took one out of the bag.<s>
I blew it up.<s>
He wagged his tail harder.<s>
"Is it your birthday, dog?"<s>
He wagged and wagged.<s>
It must be his birthday!<s>
I baked him a bright yellow cake and blew up more balloons.<s>
I played his favorite music.<s>
We had a party.<s>
It was so much fun!<s>
