Anna loved the beach and went as often as she could.<s>
She liked the birds and the waves.<s>
Jason did not like the beach.<s>
He did not like how warm the sand was.<s>
He didn't like the salt in the water.<s>
Jason wanted to stay home.<s>
Jason went to the beach with his mother and father and met Anna.<s>
She had a red kite that Jason liked very much.<s>
Anna was having trouble getting the kite in the air and was sad.<s>
Jason went over to help her and together they got the kite into the air and watched it go higher and higher.<s>
Anna let Jason fly the kite for a little bit.<s>
After that Jason was hungry.<s>
Anna showed him that she had brought a green Picnic basket from her house.<s>
Inside the picnic basket there were cakes and sandwiches and salad and some fruit.<s>
Jason had brought lemonade in a blue bottle and shared it with Anna.<s>
It was the most fun Jason had at the beach.<s>
