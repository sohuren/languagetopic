Santa Claus makes sure that every year at Christmas time that his reindeer are ready to deliver gifts to girls and boys all over the world.<s>
Without the reindeer, how would Santa fly from home to home?<s>
The most important thing that Santa has to do for the reindeer is to make sure they have their coffee on Christmas Eve.<s>
Without the coffee, they won't stay awake for very long.<s>
Sleeping reindeer are not very helpful.<s>
Santa also gives the reindeer candy to keep up their energy.<s>
In the North Pole, the main candy is candy canes in red and white.<s>
Reindeer love the candy canes that are different colors best and Santa says that helps them fly faster.<s>
Next, Santa has to make sure that the reindeer have a good meal before they go.<s>
Santa wants to make sure he doesn't have to share the cookies kids leave for him.<s>
The last thing Santa has to do is make sure the reindeer know where they are going.<s>
Santa has only been lost one time on Christmas Eve and he does not want that to happen again.<s>
