There was once a magical lightning wand that contained special powers.<s>
When held by a human, it is believed to have given the human special powers that would allow them to take over the skies and the sea.<s>
Because of its dangerous power, a king named Ogthar wanted to hide the wand on a planet where no one could find it.<s>
Before Ogthar went out to hide his wand, he had to tie his shoelaces.<s>
Instead of tying them with his hands, he waved the wand to make it do it for him.<s>
Instead of tying his shoes, the wind and sky blew the shoes right off of Ogthar.<s>
Ogthar cried and cried because he no longer had shoes.<s>
After 17 days of crying, Ogthar saw that his life was not terrible without shoes, because he still had a magical wand.<s>
Ogthar then forgot about his shoes and instead made a magical land called "Wind and Sky Land" for children to gather and play in the fun wind and seas.<s>
Ogthar forgot about his shoes after a couple of years and even went on to go to school and get smarter.<s>
Ogthar is now a fireman and is glad that he never hid the wand.<s>
He now can never die and whenever he thinks of his shoes, he says to himself "Stop it!"<s>
