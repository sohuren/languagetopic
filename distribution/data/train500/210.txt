Once there was a fish who had lived his whole life in his bowl.<s>
He often got bored and wished to see the rest of the world, but because he was a fish, he couldn't leave the water.<s>
So one day he made a special fish suit that would allow him to walk on land and breathe air like humans.<s>
He knew this would change his life, and make him rich, but first he would have to test it out.<s>
He put the suit on and leaped from the bowl that until now had been his whole world.<s>
The suit worked!<s>
Now he could go where he wanted.<s>
First he went to the kitchen of the house.<s>
There he saw a parrot eating a cracker.<s>
Second he went outside to the yard.<s>
He saw squirrels there running around looking for food.<s>
Third he went to the barn in the field.<s>
He saw a mommy cow.<s>
She was teaching her calf how to run.<s>
Finally he went to forest where he saw more trees than he had ever seen in his whole life.<s>
But after all this he was tired, and made up his mind to go back to his home in the bowl.<s>
It was a lot of work trying to see the world.<s>
He took off the special suit and splashed back into the water.<s>
His suit had passed the test and he was very happy, but he had made up his mind that his bowl was the place for him.<s>
