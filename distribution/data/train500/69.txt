Gia was new in the neighborhood.<s>
She really wanted to meet some new friends.<s>
She was lonely and tired of playing with her toys all by herself.<s>
Her mother told her that the best way to meet new friends was to go somewhere where other kids are at.<s>
She remembered seeing a park on the corner when they were moving in.<s>
She asked her mother if she could go to the park.<s>
Her mother walked her down the street to the park.<s>
When Gia got to the park she was not happy.<s>
There was no one there.<s>
She sat on a swing and looked at the ground.<s>
It seemed like this was going to be another lonely day.<s>
Gia heard a noise and looked up.<s>
There was a girl coming down the hill.<s>
She smiled, but she was a little scared.<s>
What if she wasn't nice?<s>
That would make her sad.<s>
Gia was so happy when the girl walked up and said, "Hi, my name is Julie.<s>
What's yours?"<s>
