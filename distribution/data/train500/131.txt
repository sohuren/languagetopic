When summertime came Jack the Pirate made up his mind it was time to get his hair cut.<s>
He told all his friends that it was because he wanted a new look.<s>
But the truth was the Sun was too hot for Jack the Pirate.<s>
His long hair only made it worse.<s>
So he left his home by Whipple Creek and went into town to visit the Edward the Barber at his barbershop.<s>
It was fun getting his hair cut, and when it was done Jack the Terrier felt fresh and cool.<s>
"Your friends won't even know it's you, Jack!"<s>
said Edward the Barber as Jack the Pirate headed out the door.<s>
On the way back home, he took a short cut through the forest, and he met three people who were his friends.<s>
First he met Ichabod the Chief of Police, who was doing an important case.<s>
Jack said "Hello, Ichabod!"<s>
but Ichabod ignored him.<s>
The second person he met was Willy the Candy Man, who was delivering delicious treats.<s>
Jack said "Howdy, Willy!"<s>
but Willy didn't say anything back.<s>
The third person Jack met was Dean the Librarian, who was looking for a book he had lost.<s>
Jack said "Hey, Dean!"<s>
but Dean didn't stop looking for his book.<s>
"That's odd," thought Jack to himself, as he arrived home.<s>
"Why did all of my friends ignore me today?"<s>
Then he looked in the mirror and saw why.<s>
He looked like a totally different person.<s>
His friends must not have even known it was him!<s>
