There was once a family called the McAllisters.<s>
There was a dad, John McAllister, a mom, Amy McAllister, and their two twins, Ally and Jonah McAllister.<s>
This family was a family family, but when it came time to eat dinner, they sometimes argued.<s>
This is because different people liked different meals.<s>
John liked chicken most of all, and Amy liked vegetables.<s>
The twins, Ally and Jonah, preferred hotdogs, but Ally preferred ketchup, and Jonah preferred mustard.<s>
When it came to every day dinners, they took turns eating what each person liked.<s>
However, when it came to special meals like thanksgiving, it was difficult for the family to choose what to have.<s>
There would be frequent fights between all of them on what they would eat.<s>
Finally, they all had the answer.<s>
They would invite their grandpa over, because their grandpa was a great cook and could make everyone's favorite food, including chicken, vegetables, and hotdogs.<s>
On Thanksgiving, everyone was happy.<s>
