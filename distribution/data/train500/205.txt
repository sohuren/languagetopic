His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock.<s>
Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat.<s>
Under the meat was a slice of dry toast.<s>
Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza.<s>
Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.<s>
Timmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys.<s>
All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste.<s>
He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train.<s>
The house was quiet and nighttime was near.<s>
He pretended he was camping.<s>
It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.<s>
He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful.<s>
If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil.<s>
Timmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat.<s>
He folded the paper into a mighty ship.<s>
In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea.<s>
Danger was all around.<s>
The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep.<s>
