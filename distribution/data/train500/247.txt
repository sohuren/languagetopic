Zebras cannot clap.<s>
However, one weekend a magic clown wiggled his nose and said a few magical words and a zebra could clap.<s>
This zebra lived in a zoo with many other zebras.<s>
This zebra's name was John, John the Zebra.<s>
John was so excited that he could clap.<s>
He tried to clap as much as he could.<s>
He had trouble understanding when and what to clap.<s>
He would clap at things that were sad and things that were happy.<s>
He clapped when he was excited and when he was scared.<s>
He even clapped that he could clap.<s>
After a couple of weeks, his friend Sam was getting annoyed with John.<s>
He said "John, I know you like clapping but I am beginning to be annoyed by your clapping."<s>
John said he was sorry, but that Sam did not understand how special it was to be the first Zebra that could clap.<s>
A few more weeks went by and the same Magical clown came by John's zoo.<s>
He looked at John, who was clapping his heart out, and wiggled his nose and said some different magical words.<s>
Suddenly, John could not clap any more.<s>
And that month was first and only time a zebra could clap.<s>
