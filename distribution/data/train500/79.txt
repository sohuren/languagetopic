At night, the magical chipmunks come out to play in the woods.<s>
They shower in bowls, and take pictures with their phones.<s>
They brush their teeth until they twinkle.<s>
They hide in the bushes and play games.<s>
There is one game they really like.<s>
To play, one chipmunk puts his ear on the phone, and another hides in the woods with a different phone.<s>
One chipmunk walks through the woods looking for the hiding chipmunk.<s>
The hiding chipmunk tells 'hot' or 'cold' to the first one on the phone.<s>
If 'hot', he is very close to finding!<s>
If 'cold', he's very far away!<s>
Chipmunks love to be hot, so there is a twist to this game!<s>
These magical chipmunks can change the temperature with their voice, so if the hiding chipmunk says cold, all the chipmunks becomes colder.<s>
If the hiding chipmunk says 'hot', all the chipmunks become hotter.<s>
Oh, how the chipmunks love to play this game!<s>
But they don't like to lose!<s>
