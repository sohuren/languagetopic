It was Saturday, and every Saturday all the children on the block would have a bicycle race.<s>
Juan rode his new red bicycle to the dead end street where the race was held.<s>
He knew he would win.<s>
His new bicycle would be faster than anyone's.<s>
Anita was there on her white bicycle.<s>
Todd was riding a blue bicycle, and Jasper soon arrived on a yellow bicycle.<s>
The race began, and Juan was in the lead.<s>
He heard Anita crying behind him.<s>
He turned to see her chain was broken, and she had fallen from her bike into the green grass.<s>
Juan stopped and turned around to help Anita.<s>
Jasper and Todd rode past them, and it was soon clear that Todd would win the race.<s>
Juan walked Anita home, and she thanked him for being a good friend.<s>
