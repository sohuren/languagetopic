There was once an animal named Eddy.<s>
He was not a dog, a bunny or a bear but a little kitten.<s>
Unlike the black, white and orange cats in his neighborhood, Eddy was a gray cat.<s>
He loved to go outside and run around the streets and the city.<s>
He liked to listen to the birds chirp and watch the children draw with chalk.<s>
He was a very smart and friendly kitten.<s>
Eddy was good at many things.<s>
He was good at hopping, running and playing.<s>
The thing Eddy was best at was climbing!<s>
His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up.<s>
Anyone who saw Eddy climb might think he was part monkey!<s>
Eddy also loved his family.<s>
When he wasn't outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat.<s>
Eddy was a very lazy cat!<s>
He loved to sleep most of the day, at least 12 hours!<s>
His family could always count on him to be sleepy.<s>
