Sally always loved the ocean.<s>
Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before.<s>
Tonight was one of those nights.<s>
As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day.<s>
She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared.<s>
All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep.<s>
In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear.<s>
He was so annoying.<s>
A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day.<s>
When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun.<s>
The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down.<s>
After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close!<s>
Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside.<s>
Sally and Jared both cheered.<s>
They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door.<s>
There were so many different flavors!<s>
Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too.<s>
Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather.<s>
Sally couldn't choose.<s>
She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out.<s>
Finally she chose the shop's special flavor "Tropical Turtle".<s>
The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.<s>
