Josh was going on an adventure.<s>
He was going to float down the river with his friends, Dennis and Connor.<s>
They had been building a boat out of wood Connor's father had given them for the last week.<s>
The boys wanted to paint the boat because the brown wood did not look very good.<s>
Josh wanted green, Dennis liked purple and Connor said it would look good if it was red.<s>
They had to call their friend, Tonya, to help choose.<s>
Tonya thought the same as Josh on the color so that is what they painted the boat.<s>
To thank Tonya for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.<s>
All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.<s>
They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.<s>
Josh's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.<s>
Everything was in a big basket.<s>
There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.<s>
Each person had a job on the boat.<s>
Josh was the captain.<s>
Dennis made sure the snacks did not get wet.<s>
Tonya watched for rocks ahead.<s>
Connor had to steer the boat.<s>
