It was Saturday afternoon and Andrew was bored.<s>
He had been watching TV all day.<s>
He told his dad, "There's nothing to do!"<s>
Andrew's dad said, "I think the newspaper is here.<s>
Maybe we can find an idea in the newspaper."<s>
Andrew looked outside the window and saw the newspaper by the door.<s>
On the front was a picture of an elephant.<s>
He picked up the newspaper and brought it to his dad.<s>
Andrew and his dad read the story.<s>
The circus was in town!<s>
Andrew had never been to the circus.<s>
He asked his dad, "Can we go?"<s>
"Yes, we can,' Andrew's dad said, 'but first you need to feed your goldfish."<s>
Andrew fed his goldfish some goldfish food.<s>
He promised to bring it some peanuts from the circus for later.<s>
Andrew and his dad went to the circus.<s>
The people and animals at the circus did lots of tricks.<s>
The elephant even went down a slide!<s>
Andrew and his dad ate lots of peanuts.<s>
There weren't any peanuts left to bring home to the goldfish.<s>
Andrew and his dad had a lot of fun at the circus.<s>
