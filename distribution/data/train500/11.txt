It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and James was going shopping with his mother.<s>
While she made her shopping list, James looked out the window.<s>
In the sky, he saw pretty birds.<s>
He smiled - James liked birds.<s>
He saw one last Friday when he was getting muddy in the puddles, and another on Wednesday when he was playing with his toy spaceship.<s>
Once his mother was done making her list, James got his shoes on before getting in the car.<s>
"Should I bring my jacket, Mom?"<s>
he asked.<s>
"No," his mother answered, fixing his hair, "it is warmer today than it was yesterday, in fact, it's hot!"<s>
James and his mother got in the car, and drove off to the store.<s>
He leaned his head on the car window, looking at the animals and trees they passed.<s>
He saw flowers, a puppy, ants, and people walking, and even a chipmunk!<s>
When they got to the store, James and his mother grabbed an empty shopping cart.<s>
James always liked helping his mother do her shopping - she sometimes let him get a treat if he was good.<s>
They went up and down the aisles, picking up the things on the list, including James' favorite food - peanut butter - and James was very well behaved.<s>
As they finished their shopping and walked to the front of the store in order to pay, James' mother said, "James, you can get a candy bar if you'd like, so I can say 'thank you' for being a super good helper today."<s>
James was so excited.<s>
He picked one with peanuts and chocolate, and placed it with the rest of their items.<s>
When they got home, James spent the rest of the day playing Legos in his room.<s>
It was a good day.<s>
