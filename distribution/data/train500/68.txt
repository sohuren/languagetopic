Robert was excited that Halloween was coming.<s>
He and his mother went to the store to look at costumes so that he could pick one.<s>
There was a a witch costume, a horse costume and a costume that looked like a doggy.<s>
Robert thought he would get the dog costume because he thought he could make a great woof sound.<s>
His mother bought it for him and he couldn't wait to wear it.<s>
On Halloween night, Robert was all dressed to go out trick or treating and waited for his Dad to take him out.<s>
His father told him that he had talked to the lady who lived next door and she was hoping that her granddaughter could go trick or treating with them.<s>
Robert thought it would be okay if she came along and they went to go pick her up.<s>
Robert found out her name was Tessa.<s>
He was happy to see that she was wearing a costume that looked like a kitten.<s>
Their costumes would go well together.<s>
They went from house to house getting candy.<s>
Some people gave them jelly beans, some gave them chocolate bars and some gave them cookies.<s>
Robert's favorite treat that they got was the chocolate bars.<s>
When they got home they saw they had both gotten a lot of candy.<s>
It was a great Halloween and Robert was very happy.<s>
