Tommy was a cowboy.<s>
He and his horse, Candy, lived by the Gentle River.<s>
The Gentle River was as clear as a mirror.<s>
One day, Tommy was riding Candy along the shore when he saw a fire in the distance.<s>
"Wow," Tommy said.<s>
"I wonder why there's a fire."<s>
Tommy and Candy went to see.<s>
The fire was deep in the hills, and it took a long time to get there.<s>
By the time they arrived, it was almost supper time.<s>
The fire was a campfire.<s>
There was a little girl at the fire.<s>
She was drawing pictures with crayons.<s>
"Hello," Tommy said.<s>
"What are you doing in the hills?"<s>
"I'm Lucy," the girl said.<s>
"I'm camping, but my tent got blown away by the wind.<s>
So I'm sitting by the fire and drawing pictures."<s>
"What are you drawing?"<s>
"I'm finishing up this drawing of a dragon," she said.<s>
Then she pointed at two drawings on the ground next to her.<s>
They were held in place with pebbles.<s>
"This is an elf," she said.<s>
"And this is a pony."<s>
"They're very pretty," Tommy said.<s>
"I'm Tommy, and this is Candy."<s>
"Pleased to meet you," Lucy said.<s>
"Would you like to draw with me?<s>
We can do a drawing of Candy together."<s>
"That would be fun," Tommy said.<s>
And so they sat down and drew a picture of Candy together.<s>
