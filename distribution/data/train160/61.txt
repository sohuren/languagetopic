Tim had always a red bike.<s>
His birthday party was coming up and he hoped that his parents would finally get him the bike.<s>
When his friends came over for the party, Tim was very worried that he wouldn't get the bike.<s>
He looked at all the presents and none of them seemed big enough to have a bike in them.<s>
Tim was sad.<s>
When it was time to open the presents he opened them one at a time.<s>
The first present was not a bike.<s>
The second present was not a bike.<s>
The third present was the biggest one.<s>
Tim knew if the bike was going to be in any of the presents it was going to be in this box.<s>
Tim opened it and there was no bike inside.<s>
Just as Tim tried not to look too upset, his Dad brought in the biggest present of them all.<s>
His Dad had been hiding the present all along.<s>
Tim opened it and his new bike was inside the box.<s>
Tim put the bike together with his Dad's help.<s>
