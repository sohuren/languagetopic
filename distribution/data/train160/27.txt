There once was a big black and white dog named Forrest.<s>
His owner's name was Jeff.<s>
Jeff thought he was the best dog in the whole world.<s>
One night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path.<s>
Both men were dressed in very nice suits.<s>
Jeff waved at the men.<s>
"Good evening," he said.<s>
"How are you tonight?"<s>
"Hello," one of the men said.<s>
"It is such a great night for walking."<s>
Jeff and Forrest kept walking down the path.<s>
It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright.<s>
When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all.<s>
They were nowhere to be seen.<s>
Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed.<s>
They were watching a television show about ghosts.<s>
"Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?"<s>
Jeff said out loud.<s>
"They did not leave a trace."<s>
Forrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood.<s>
He barked.<s>
Jeff smiled.<s>
He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.<s>
