Jake wanted to eat an orange.<s>
He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house were apples, which he didn't like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy.<s>
But his mother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator.<s>
Jake couldn't reach the top of the refrigerator.<s>
He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards.<s>
But the stool wasn't tall enough on its own.<s>
He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen sink he could reach the oranges.<s>
(The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator).<s>
So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of the sink to get the oranges.<s>
He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on top of the refrigerator.<s>
Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange.<s>
He sat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.<s>
Then he took all of the pieces of orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.<s>
