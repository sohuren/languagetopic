Hawthorne rolled over in bed and looked around the room.<s>
He let out a breath.<s>
His eyes were half-closed as he shoved the covers back from his bed, and moved towards the door.<s>
He knew that he had to check on Kate, if he did nothing else.<s>
She was ill, with a heart problem, and he worried about her all the time.<s>
They both lived in a home for orphans, and he had since his parents had died, when he was the age of four.<s>
He had taken care of Kate as if she were his sister ever since.<s>
He wandered to her room sitting himself by her on her bed, shoving her hair from her face.<s>
She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, "Kate."<s>
He said into her ear, "It's time to wake up."<s>
He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened.<s>
"Hawthy?"<s>
She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips.<s>
"Yea."<s>
He moved her hair.<s>
"I want to go outside today," she said, and he nodded in response.<s>
"If you are up to it, I won't stop you", he told her, and she smiled.<s>
"Thanks Hawthy", she said.<s>
It wasn't long until she fell back to sleep.<s>
