There once was a woman named Mary.<s>
Mary's best friend was a dog named Buddy.<s>
Mary and Buddy went everywhere together.<s>
They had a lot in common.<s>
They both liked to play games like fetch and hide and seek.<s>
Neither of them liked to take a bath.<s>
Mary and Buddy enjoyed smelling flowers and eating hamburgers.<s>
But they also were very different from one another.<s>
For one thing, Buddy was a dog!<s>
Buddy liked talking to strangers and visiting new places.<s>
But Mary was shy.<s>
One day a man named John came by.<s>
Mary hid behind a tree when she saw him.<s>
Buddy tried to tell her it was okay, but she was too scared to listen.<s>
So Buddy went out to say hello to John.<s>
John was very nice and he liked the same games as Buddy.<s>
Mary watched Buddy chase after a ball John threw.<s>
She could tell John was a nice man.<s>
She wanted to play too.<s>
Buddy saw her watching and led his new friend over to Mary.<s>
John waved to Mary and brought her a flower.<s>
Mary smiled at him.<s>
She thought he was very kind and she wasn't as nervous as before.<s>
Buddy barked happily.<s>
Yay for new friends!<s>
