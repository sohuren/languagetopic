In a quiet house there was a dog named Bentley.<s>
Bentley was a little brown puppy and he was always getting into trouble.<s>
One day Bentley got outside and walked down the street.<s>
He found a trash can and started to dig through it.<s>
A cat came also to see what Bentley was doing.<s>
"Excuse me, but what are you looking for?"<s>
asked the cat.<s>
"Well, nothing important," Bentley told the cat.<s>
"I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there."<s>
The cat told Bentley that his name was Felix and asked if he could dig through the trash too.<s>
"Sure thing" Bentley told the cat.<s>
The two of them started to dig through the trash again.<s>
After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going away from Bentley's house.<s>
They walked to a river and went to the edge of the water.<s>
They saw they were dirty because they had been digging in the trash so they went into the water to wash themselves.<s>
When they were clean they went back to Bentley's house.<s>
Inside the house they got water on everything because they were still wet.<s>
Bentley's human's came home and were very upset that their house was now very wet.<s>
