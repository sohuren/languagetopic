One sunny day, Martha went on a walk through the park.<s>
While walking, she noticed something strange.<s>
No one was outside.<s>
She was the only person at the park.<s>
"How strange, where is everyone?"<s>
she thought.<s>
Martha looked everywhere.<s>
She looked inside the restrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide.<s>
She was confused.<s>
Usually, she would see her friends playing with each other.<s>
She started walking again when one of her friends popped up, surprising her.<s>
Her friend asked her, "Why are you outside?"<s>
Martha asked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play.<s>
Her friend then looked at her strangely and asked, "Didn't Stephan invite you to his party?"<s>
Martha hadn't known that Stephan was holding a party.<s>
She was sad that he hadn't invited her.<s>
She walked back home, upset.<s>
