The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm.<s>
The farm was a long ways from their school.<s>
The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses.<s>
The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family.<s>
They grew corn.<s>
Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too.<s>
The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended.<s>
Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor.<s>
The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals.<s>
In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses.<s>
Everyone fed hay to some of the cows.<s>
The farmers got milk from their cows.<s>
Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them.<s>
All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had.<s>
They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below.<s>
Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished.<s>
The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats.<s>
The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns!<s>
When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home.<s>
They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children.<s>
But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear.<s>
