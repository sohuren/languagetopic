A little boy named Joey did not like to brush his teeth.<s>
One day, as his mother asked him to brush his teeth, Joey said, "I don't want to!<s>
It's gross and a waste of time!"<s>
In response, Joey's mom told him that in order for him to grow up and be big and strong like she is, he must brush his teeth.<s>
In disgust, with his mom watching to make sure he brushed his teeth right, he brushed his teeth and whined until he was finished.<s>
The next day, Joey did not brush his teeth and told his mom that he did.<s>
After going to school, one of Joey's friends said that his breath stunk and began to make fun of him.<s>
This made Joey very angry, so he pushed the boy over and started to cry.<s>
A teacher came over and called the principal as both kids were being loud and starting a fight.<s>
Joey's mom came to school and took him home.<s>
After asking what was wrong, Joey told his mom that he didn't brush his teeth.<s>
After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth.<s>
"You won't get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!"<s>
she yelled, and then left the room.<s>
From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn't make fun of him.<s>
