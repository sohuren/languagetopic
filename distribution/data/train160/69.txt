Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.<s>
Max and Mary would go on all sorts of adventures together.<s>
They really loved looking for blueberries together and then falling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.<s>
One day, as Mary was picking the blueberries, she turned around to find that Max was not there.<s>
She became worried and ran off to look for her dog.<s>
She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place behind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.<s>
But poor Max was nowhere to be found.<s>
Nonetheless, Mary would not give up.<s>
She kept looking and she found him not very far away.<s>
He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.<s>
When Mary called Max's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to Mary, wagging his tail as he went.<s>
