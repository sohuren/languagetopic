Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house.<s>
The sound of the wind is like someone crying.<s>
It made the old woman nervous.<s>
She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.<s>
Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy.<s>
She still was having trouble falling asleep.<s>
She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house.<s>
Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.<s>
It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep.<s>
The crying sound got louder.<s>
It didn't seem like it was outside.<s>
It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed.<s>
When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister.<s>
She still looked five years old.<s>
The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.<s>
"What's wrong?"<s>
she asked her sister.<s>
"I miss you.<s>
I am so lonely," answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her.<s>
The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister.<s>
That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.<s>
"She died in her sleep."<s>
"It is best that way."<s>
