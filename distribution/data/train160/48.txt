James was a nice old man who lived by himself.<s>
Every day he would walk down the road by his house and say hello to everyone.<s>
It was fun saying hello to everyone but he felt lonely sometimes.<s>
He wanted a pet to take care of.<s>
One day as he was walking down the road a little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted James to pet him.<s>
James reached down and petted the puppy and smiled.<s>
James hoped to see the puppy again.<s>
Many days later James went for a walk again.<s>
He thought to himself, "I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again.<s>
I hoped to see him again."<s>
A nice young lady said to James, "Would you like a puppy?"<s>
James said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before."<s>
The lady smiled.<s>
She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy.<s>
She told James that she found the little puppy in the woods.<s>
She said that the little puppy did not have a family.<s>
James said happily, "I would love to give the puppy a home!"<s>
So James grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home.<s>
James and the little brown puppy became great friends.<s>
James named him Spotty.<s>
