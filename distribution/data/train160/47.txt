So Bobby's mother put him on a bus to the city and his grandmother picked him up at the Port Authority bus stop.<s>
They took the train back to the school.<s>
They put Bobby's backpack on a rack in the guest room.<s>
Then Bobby and his grandmother went out for a walk.<s>
They stopped at a corner shop for pizza and sodas.<s>
Then they walked to the Empire State Building.<s>
At the top of the Empire State Building they looked out over the city.<s>
They counted all the bridges and looked at all the tall buildings.<s>
Bobby bought three postcards and a little snow globe in the shop.<s>
Then they took the elevator back to the ground floor.<s>
Next they took a yellow cab to Central Park.<s>
They rode the carousel and went to the zoo.<s>
Bobby's favorite animals were the monkeys.<s>
He did not like the snakes at all.<s>
After they had ice cream cones, Bobby and his grandmother took the train back to her school.<s>
They had salads for supper.<s>
Then they read a story together.<s>
Bobby's grandmother made up her sofa bed for Bobby as they made plans for the next day.<s>
Bobby wanted to know if they could go to a baseball game.<s>
His grandmother said she would get tickets.<s>
