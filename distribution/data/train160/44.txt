Bob walked out the door with a huge grin on his face.<s>
It was his first day of middle school.<s>
His mom, who is a nurse at the high school, waved at him as he entered the bus.<s>
The bus driver said "good to see you Bob".<s>
Bob said "you too Mr. Smith".<s>
Bob was so excited to see his friends that he could barely breathe.<s>
As he walked down the school bus, Bob's friends Jill, Jim, Jeff and Chris all waved to him.<s>
Instead of sitting next to his best friend Chris, Bob turned left and sat next to Jill.<s>
Jeff and Jim started laughing at him and teased "Bob and Jill sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G".<s>
Bob's face turned red from embarrassment.<s>
Chris felt bad for Bob and reached into his pockets to help his friend.<s>
When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper.<s>
Chris's eyes twinkled.<s>
He had a plan.<s>
Without Jim and Jeff seeing, Chris quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket.<s>
He threw the paper airplane at Jim.<s>
The plane hit Jim in the face.<s>
Both Jim and Jeff stopped laughing.<s>
Bob looked over to Chris and smiled.<s>
