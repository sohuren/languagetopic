Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named Winston, Chester, and Francis.<s>
Chester was a brown rabbit with large eyes.<s>
Francis was grey and white and had messy fur.<s>
Winston was black and very fat.<s>
They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat.<s>
Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass.<s>
They loved to eat that grass.<s>
One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting.<s>
At first he thought it might be dirt.<s>
Then he thought maybe some sort of flower.<s>
So, he asked a nearby squirrel.<s>
The squirrel's name was Acorn.<s>
Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms.<s>
However, Francis, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he learned that it was actually a garden of carrots.<s>
The rabbits were all excited.<s>
They all loved carrots!<s>
They ate all the carrots.<s>
