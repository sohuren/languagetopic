A day at the beach.<s>
When Sam woke in the morning, he was super excited!<s>
Today was the day!<s>
It was Sunday, the day that Sam's mom and dad had promised to take Sam to the beach.<s>
Sam's grandma had given a pail and shovel to Sam to use in the sand.<s>
At breakfast Sam was so excited he was wiggling in his seat!<s>
Mom told Sam that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10, and the little had was pointing to the 12.<s>
Mom asked Sam if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam said that he wanted to help.<s>
Dad said, "let's make a game of it, we need to make a sandwich for each of us.<s>
There are three of us, so we need three sandwiches.<s>
Let's count as we make the sandwiches!"<s>
Sam counted as mom made the sandwiches, one for dad, one for mom and one for Sam.<s>
Then mom started to make another sandwich!<s>
"Mom!"<s>
said Sam, "we have three sandwiches and that makes one sandwich for each of us."<s>
Sam's mom laughed, "You're right Sam!"<s>
Sam's mom said she was being silly.<s>
