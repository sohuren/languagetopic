John thought about things that he liked to do.<s>
Well, for one, he liked baseball.<s>
Compared to his friends, he was very good at the sport.<s>
He didn't even have to practice that much.<s>
He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park.<s>
Home run!<s>
He was also a fan of basketball.<s>
He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes).<s>
He wasn't quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line.<s>
He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.<s>
Finally, he loved football.<s>
Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football himself, but he was drawn to the games.<s>
He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends.<s>
He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.<s>
