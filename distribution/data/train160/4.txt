Two best friends lived in a small town.<s>
They grew up together and did everything together.<s>
One boy was named James, and he was a cute, fat kid who was always picked on.<s>
And then the other boy was named Alex, and he was handsome and cool.<s>
They were opposites, but they didn't care.<s>
Alex would always protect James from the bullies because James was weak.<s>
One day, James was being teased by the bullies, Gordon and Johnny, but Alex wasn't there to save him.<s>
James didn't know what to do and was scared.<s>
But then he remembered all of the times Alex stood up for him.<s>
James looked up to Alex and he thought of him as his hero.<s>
James wanted to protect himself and not have Alex always come to help.<s>
So this time, James got up and was brave.<s>
He stood up to Gordon and Johnny and told them that he wasn't scared.<s>
The bullies didn't know what to do and then gave up.<s>
They went away to look for more fun things to do.<s>
Alex saw the whole thing and was proud of James for being brave.<s>
Now James and Alex protect each other and stand up for each other.<s>
They still are the best of friends.<s>
