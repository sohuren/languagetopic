Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.<s>
And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.<s>
One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.<s>
On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.<s>
When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!<s>
You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"<s>
Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.<s>
Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.<s>
Looking down, Freddy was scared.<s>
He had never ridden down this hill before.<s>
His friends said, "What are you, scared?"<s>
Freddy did not want to come off as scared.<s>
He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.<s>
Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.<s>
He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.<s>
Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.<s>
He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.<s>
He awoke the next day in the hospital.<s>
At the hospital, his mother was there.<s>
Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.<s>
He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.<s>
His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.<s>
She didn't have to say it.<s>
In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.<s>
