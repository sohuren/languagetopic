On Saturday, Amy and Joe baked a whole chicken for their family's dinner.<s>
They rinsed it in cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.<s>
After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.<s>
Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.<s>
Amy said, "Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night.<s>
We'll have leftovers.<s>
What can we do with the leftover chicken?"<s>
Joe said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice."<s>
Amy said, "How about chicken soup?"<s>
Cindy said, "I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.<s>
We haven't made those in a long time."<s>
"That sounds good," said Amy.<s>
"We'll make that for dinner tomorrow."<s>
"Yum!"<s>
said Joe.<s>
"That's a great idea.<s>
I love Thai noodles."<s>
Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.<s>
"I don't understand how to do these math problems!"<s>
Joe said, "You two go ahead.<s>
I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers."<s>
Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.<s>
Joe was eating the chicken.<s>
It was almost gone!<s>
"Dad!"<s>
said Cindy, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken.<s>
We can't have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow."<s>
Joe looked very sad.<s>
He said "I'm sorry.<s>
I have been a bad dad.<s>
I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.<s>
Would you like a piece of chicken?"<s>
