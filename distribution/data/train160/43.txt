Bailey and her friend Kara were bored one Saturday.<s>
It was a hot summer day.<s>
They didn't want to stay inside any longer but they didn't know what to do.<s>
They were tired of watching TV inside.<s>
Suddenly, Kara had an idea.<s>
She said, "Bailey, we could make some money."<s>
"How?<s>
," asked Bailey.<s>
"Well, it is hot outside," said Kara.<s>
"People are thirsty out there.<s>
We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay for it."<s>
"That is a great idea," answered Bailey, "let's do it!"<s>
Kara had made some iced tea with her mom earlier that day.<s>
She asked her mom permission to use it.<s>
Her mom said yes.<s>
She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.<s>
They got a cooler full of ice and made a sign so people knew what was for sale.<s>
Kara's mom helped them get a table and chairs and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.<s>
It was so hot out that people who saw their stand came to buy drinks right away.<s>
Their first visitors to their stand were their friends, Abby and Molly.<s>
In a half hour, they had to close their stand.<s>
They were all out of lemonade and iced tea.<s>
They had made a lot of money.<s>
They split the money and each got ten dollars.<s>
It was a great day.<s>
