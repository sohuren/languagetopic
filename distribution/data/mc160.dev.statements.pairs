Sally&#39;s favorite activity was walking in the woods because she enjoyed nature. Tina liked arts and crafts. Together, they made some art using leaves they found in the woods. Even after she fell in the water, Sally still enjoyed canoeing. She was sad when the camp was over, but promised to keep in touch with her new friend.  Sally went to the beach with her family in the summer as well. She loves the beach. Sally collected shells and mailed some to her friend, Tina, so she could make some arts and crafts with them.

She missed her friends and teachers. She was excited to tell them about her summer vacation.</t>

The ice cream truck driver thought that no more children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb when they got to the corner. They yelled.  They screamed, &quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; and jumped up and down on the side walk trying to get him to see them. The driver of the truck saw them, waved at them and smiled, pulled back to the curb and opened his truck up so that they could see everything that he had for sale.  They were so excited. They saw some new treats. Tony wanted to try something new. He got an ice cream sundae with chocolate ice cream and nuts. He almost got a snow cone. Greta looked at everything that the ice cream truck had. She saw candy, ice cream cones, snow cones, and everything else. It all looked so good. But after looking at everything, she wanted to get an ice cream sandwich. She got the ice cream sandwich. She bit into it and smiled. It tasted so good. She felt so happy. Her brother, Tony, was happy too. He bit into his ice cream cone sundae and grinned.  They walked home with their ice cream and told their mom about how close they came to not getting their ice cream at all. Their mom was happy that the truck had stopped for them. She said that they were very lucky to have gotten to the curb before the ice cream truck left.</t>

This year my parents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.  After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the long car ride there.    Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much to see and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family!    We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places. There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  My brother, Kelsey, and I played hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.  It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories.

      <t>Roger was a grasshopper. He loved to hop. He hopped everywhere by himself. One day when he was hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log. The frog told him his name was Gilbert. Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into anybody. Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would make great friends. The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something very strange.  In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad. The spider was very sad because he did not have any friends. Roger and Gilbert asked him why he didn&#39;t have any friends. The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him. Roger and Gilbert told him that he didn&#39;t look scary to them and that he could come along with them if he wanted. So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a life time friendship full of adventures.</t>

Sara wondered if she could hit a ball. She wasn&#39;t sure if she would be any good. She really wanted to play on a team and wear a real uniform. She couldn&#39;t wait to get to the park and test out her bat. When Sara and her Dad reached the park, Sara grabbed the bat and stood a few steps away from her Dad. Sara waited as her Dad pitched the ball to her. Her heart was beating fast. She missed the first few pitches. She felt like quitting but kept trying. Soon she was hitting the ball very far. She was very happy and she couldn&#39;t wait to sign up for a real team. Her Dad was very proud of her for not giving up.</t>

He was watching three TV shows that night.  First, was Muffins the Cat.  The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey.  The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster.  His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn&#39;t listen.  He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night.  First about sheep jumping fences.  Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.  Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.  His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face.  Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning.  His Mom drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  Douglas had to sit out the first quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.  The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.  Usually he was fast.  After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep.  The third quarter started.  Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game.  Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two.  Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face.  Douglas got up and stretched.  He was finally well rested.  The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game.  Douglas remembered his dream.  In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered.  Since that time, Douglas goes to bed on time.  He always wants to be well rested.  His Mom was right.  He gave her a hug.</t>

Brian&#39;s baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian&#39;s dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.

Brian&#39;s baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian&#39;s dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.

      <t>On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach. When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn&#39;t find anything. This made Bob and Sally very sad. They gave up and went to play in the water. While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside. Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map. Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found a box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl. The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich. Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.</t>

      <h>Bob and Sally stoped looking for the treasure because They got hungry.</h>

      <t>It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.  On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to &quot;say&quot; to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the &quot;where are you&quot; call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.</t>

      <t>One day Magneson took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond was a duck named George.  George&#39;s wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy.  Magneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy&#39;s son.  He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.  Magneson asked what their son&#39;s name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was only making small talk.  He didn&#39;t believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He could also hide in the tall grass.  George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn&#39;t listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.

      <t>Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.  He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn&#39;t purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret&#39;s mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled &quot;Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!&quot;, to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn&#39;t care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he&#39;d end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.</t>

      <t>Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn&#39;t even look like a cat!  All of the other cats teased Puddles. &quot;You&#39;re too big,&quot; they said. &quot;You&#39;ve got too long of a nose!&quot; &quot;Why are you panting like that?&quot; Puddles knew that he was different.  One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Didn&#39;t he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? Puddles didn&#39;t care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.  So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!  Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family. Puddles was never lonely again.</t>
