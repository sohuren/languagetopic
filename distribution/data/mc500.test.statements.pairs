      <t>Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long.  One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. &quot;What is it?&quot; said Asta&#39;s friend Sharkie. &quot;It looks like a bird&#39;s belly,&quot; said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird&#39;s belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it.   The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta&#39;s papa. &quot;What does it say?&quot; they asked.   Asta&#39;s papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, &quot;This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her.&quot; And that is what they did.</t>

Derek knew that Sandy did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown. All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to Derek and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy. He told Derek he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot. Derek remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man. Sandy and Alexis were on the jungle gym and they saw Derek running from the stranger. They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom.

Sandy and Alexis were on the jungle gym and they saw Derek running from the stranger. They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom. Sandy and Alexis came into the classroom screaming for help. Derek ran into the classroom right after the girls. Mrs. Mustard looked out into the recess yard, but the stranger was gone. Jenny, Mrs. Mustard&#39;s helper, called the police to report what had happened.</t>

Larry did not want to chase mice. Larry wanted to drink some milk. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said &quot;too bad.&quot; So everyone went off to chase mice.

He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, &quot;Too bad.&quot; So everyone went off to annoy the dogs. Except Larry. When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry. They started growling. They caught the kittens in their paws. The kittens yelled, &quot;Help us!&quot; Larry heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs. The dogs could not see Larry, only his shadow, which looked very big. The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered. &quot;Yay Larry! We&#39;ll do anything you want!&quot;</t>

This was his favorite drink. But along the ride, Kyle&#39;s dad had a scare. The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book. Later he found his book in a white bin. Along with the book, there was a white costume. He thought that maybe this was a sign. So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume. He remembered that his son Kyle&#39;s favorite thing to do was play doctor. This made him remember that he never even asked his son Kyle if he wanted to come for the ride. So the dad turned around and drove all the way home to get his son. He asked Kyle if he wanted to come out to breakfast. Kyle got very excited and said he did. Kyle&#39;s dad was happy he came back because it helped him make his son happy.</t>

When they got to the house, his auntie was waiting there with a cake for them.  Jack was excited and finished the sandwiches that she had made them for lunch.  When they were finished his uncle told him that it was time to go home.  It was getting late and Jack was going to be late for his bedtime if they didn&#39;t hurry.  His bedtime was going to be a little earlier tonight because he had to go visit the doctor tomorrow and so there would be no story time before bed.    Jack told his uncle that he had a great day and hoped that they could do it again soon.</t>
      <h>Jack saw a butterfly in by the house.</h>

      <t>Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either!  Where would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue.  Wait, what&#39;s that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren&#39;t? I think that could still be my friend! I&#39;ll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There&#39;s my friend! And he&#39;s wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!</t>

After they would be planted, they would water and weed the garden every day. In the afternoons, Grandpa would take Josh out on the ocean in his sailboat which was named &quot;Sea girl.&quot; Josh loved &quot;Sea girl&quot; and his favorite part was smelling the salty ocean air. Sometimes Josh and Grandpa would go to a beach and make sandcastles, or start digging until they found buried sea shells or other treasures. At night, Grandma and Grandpa would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool. On special nights, Josh got to get ice cream for dessert.

They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use. One person wanted to do a dance show. Another person wanted to put on a play. So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone&#39;s idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, &quot;musical&quot;. So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical.  The first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job. Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show. Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights. Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes. Later, Joe wanted more singers so he added Sam and Marsha as singers.  On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended. Joe and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream. The ice cream shop was all out of Joe&#39;s favorite flavor, strawberry, so Joe chose to get chocolate ice cream instead.</t>

So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone&#39;s idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, &quot;musical&quot;. So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical.  The first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job. Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show. Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights. Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes. Later, Joe wanted more singers so he added Sam and Marsha as singers.  On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended. Joe and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream. The ice cream shop was all out of Joe&#39;s favorite flavor, strawberry, so Joe chose to get chocolate ice cream instead.</t>

Sarah&#39;s dad gave her a hug as they walked to the pear tree. When they picked pears, Sarah&#39;s dad had to lift her on his back, because she could not reach the pears high in the tree. Sarah and her dad picked thirty four in five hours! Sarah was hungry, so her dad said she could eat one of the pears they picked. While she was eating, she didn&#39;t say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.  She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.  When they got home, Sarah&#39;s grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.  As Sarah was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.</t>

You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television.

As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch. He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on. He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple. He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor.

He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple. He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor. The fox slipped and he fell off the branch, but landed safely in a pile of leaves near the apple. He picked up the apple in his mouth and quickly brought it back to his warm den. When he arrived back home, his two fox kits were waiting for him with hungry tummies. Spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it was always warm in the fox den.</t>

The frog put all the ingredients in a bowl and started mixing them up. &quot;I&#39;m going to make the best cake ever!&quot; he said. He took the cake and poured it into a blue bowl and popped it into the oven. He waited, and then, when it was done, he took it out. It was nice and golden brown.

Little Bunny thought and thought.  He wanted to invite Rabbit, Bear, Duck and Goose.  Little Bunny could invite one more friend. He thought about Turtle.

He told his mother his idea. &quot;I like both Turtle and Fox, and I want them both to come.  One would feel really left out if they didn&#39;t get invited.  I can give my cake to one of my friends, and that way they can both come and have a piece.&quot; His mother thought it was very sweet of Little Bunny to give up his piece of birthday cake so that none of his friends would feel left out. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what.&quot; Said his mother.  &quot;I&#39;ll make a batch of cupcakes, and all of your friends can have some.&quot;</t>

      <t>There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.    All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn&#39;t know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said &quot;Animal Control&quot;.  Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn&#39;t know where to find her, but she knew Patty&#39;s phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker&#39;s attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.    After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.  Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.</t>

      <t>There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.    All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn&#39;t know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said &quot;Animal Control&quot;.  Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn&#39;t know where to find her, but she knew Patty&#39;s phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker&#39;s attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.    After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.  Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.</t>

Food shopping was one of Ashley&#39;s favorite things to do. The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart. The first foods they ran into were the fruits. Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons. As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread. After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food. Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different. The checkout lady, Sarah, was extra nice to her and as she was waiting for her parents to pay, Ashley&#39;s father picked out a candy for her to have. It was her favorite, chocolate! Ashley was so excited that she thanked her parents the whole ride home, and even said she would make breakfast. When the family got home that afternoon and the food was in the house, the whole family made their lunch of eggs and toast together.</t>

      <t>One morning a girl named Ashely woke up before her Mom and Dad and started watching TV. Once her parents woke up, everybody got dressed to go food shopping for the week. Food shopping was one of Ashley&#39;s favorite things to do. The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart. The first foods they ran into were the fruits. Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons. As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread. After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food. Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different. The checkout lady, Sarah, was extra nice to her and as she was waiting for her parents to pay, Ashley&#39;s father picked out a candy for her to have. It was her favorite, chocolate! Ashley was so excited that she thanked her parents the whole ride home, and even said she would make breakfast. When the family got home that afternoon and the food was in the house, the whole family made their lunch of eggs and toast together.</t>

      <t>One day John and Sally&#39;s mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn&#39;t have the ingredients.

Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.  &quot;We&#39;re sorry!&quot; they both said to their mother. &quot;We&#39;ll never be disobedient again!&quot;  And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.</t>

      <t>Animals love to walk near the train tracks. One night a beautiful black cat was walking along the train tracks looking for a nice mouse to eat. He came across some friends, Bob the cat and Steve the dog. They chose to go looking for food together. They walked up and down the tracks looking for a wonderful meal to snack on, when they happened across a big huge melon. Bob asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. Bob asked the dog if he liked melons, Steve did not like melons either. Bob then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby.

A man in a black and white striped shirt blew his whistle to start the game.  It was hot so Jane&#39;s coach handed out orange slices for the players to eat at half time.  Jane&#39;s team was winning but she was more excited for what she would do in the afternoon.  Her father was going to take her to watch a baseball game.  When the soccer game was over, Jane took off her soccer shoes and put them next to her father&#39;s running shoes in the back of his car.  Jane and her father drove to the baseball game.

A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that Moon had one too. Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon. She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon. &quot;Oh, I think I&#39;m going to get Moon a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!&quot; That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. Star, but since Saturn was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. Star couldn&#39;t do it too! &quot;Try asking Mars.&quot; said Saturn. &quot;He might know what to get Moon.&quot; Ms. Star asked Mars. &quot;Well,&quot; said Mars. &quot;I know that I&#39;m getting Moon a space ship, and that Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are going together to get Moon a new house.&quot; &quot;Wow!&quot; said Ms. Star. &quot;How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?&quot; Mars thought about it for a little bit. &quot;Hmm.&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe you could make him something?&quot; &quot;What a great idea!&quot; said Ms. Star. &quot;I know what would be perfect to make for him!&quot; That night, at Moon&#39;s birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. &quot;It&#39;s the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!&quot; He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust. &quot;It&#39;s so cold here in space!

      <t>My cat&#39;s name is Buggleton. She is black and white with big green eyes and very long whiskers, like a bug.  When I woke up this morning, my cat was not inside the house. She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases. She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures. We can lock the cat door so she can&#39;t go outside when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her.   So it was very weird to wake up and see that she was not home for her morning food! My husband and neighbor and I called for her, but she did not come. Guess where she was? Trapped in the garage overnight!</t>

      <t>When Graham was a little boy, he really like giraffes.  They were his favorite animal to see at the zoo.  He liked giraffes more than elephants, pandas, tigers or lions.  He dreamed of going to Africa to see giraffes in the wild.  He told his family how much he liked them and they made sure he had plenty of books about giraffes.  At school, he often wrote his reports about giraffes.  He even painted his room with spots to look like a giraffe.  When he got older, he went to school to study giraffes and other animals.  Finally, during his final year of school, he went to Africa to study giraffes in their home.    While there he met many people who also liked giraffes.  He liked seeing how tall the giraffes were.  He found that their homes were being destroyed by people using the land.  Graham started an organization which raised money to help buy land for the giraffes to live on.  Graham used everything he knew about giraffes to teach other people.  He gave speeches, wrote books, made signs and sent letters telling people about the giraffes&#39; home being destroyed.</t>

      <t>Marvin woke up on Monday morning. He yawned and stretched and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. When he got there he brushed his teeth and combed his hair. He went to the kitchen, where he poured some milk into his favorite green bowl and added some cereal. After he finished eating, he went back up to his bedroom to choose his clothes for the day. He put on a red T-shirt and blue jeans, and some funny blue-and-yellow socks. He looked in the mirror and smiled. It was going to be a good day. Marvin thought he would go for a walk. He opened his door and went outside. The sun was shining and he could hear the bluebirds in the trees. Marvin started to whistle a happy song as he made his way down the street. He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. &quot;Hi Marvin,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you want to go to the lake today?&quot; Marvin smiled. &quot;Yeah!&quot; he said, &quot;let me go home and get my things.&quot; So Marvin turned right around and went back home.</t>

      <t>There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him.   One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep.   Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.  &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; asked the mouse in surprise.   &quot;I am trying to find dinner,&quot; said the cat.   The mouse smiled. &quot;I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?&quot;  The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. &quot;Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK.&quot;   The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.</t>

Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.

      <t>Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor&#39;s boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.  Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.  She marked the chores she had completed her to-do list, then it was time for dinner.  First she filled the food bowl of her pet cat, Zoey, then she heated up some leftover lemon-garlic chicken saved from earlier in the week.  After dinner she made her bed with fresh sheets from the laundry she did earlier, finished reading her book, put on her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and went to sleep.  Overall, it had been a quiet but good day for Sherry, and she fell asleep feeling happy.</t>

So Rachel knew this really was a kitten without a home.   She knew she would have enough money to pay for the kitten&#39;s food and care. She knew she could make enough time to play with the kitten too keep it happy. She paid the doctor to give the kitten its shots. She brought it back home and gave it food and toys. Rachel and the kitten lived happily together for years.</t>

The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She couldn&#39;t find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it. She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up. Then the puppy yawned. Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow.

If he couldn&#39;t find this book his class would not get a party. This was not going to be good.  Che called for his dad. He was going to need help finding this book if he was going to get to school on time. His father told him that he needs to take better care of his things. He told him that he would help him find his book.  They looked in every room of the house together. They checked the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. Finally his father had an idea. He moved the couch and there was the book! Che was very happy. He would help his class get a pizza party.</t>

      <t>There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet. One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.  Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet&#39;s toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.   While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.  Jacob&#39;s mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. &quot;What a peaceful group,&quot; she thought. And then she yawned and said, &quot;Now I am feeling sleepy too!&quot;</t>

      <t>There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet. One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.  Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet&#39;s toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.   While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too.

Tim&#39;s favorite animal was the crocodile because it looked tough.    Natalie, Logan, and Tim were not happy with the elephant.  He was their least favorite animal.

Paul is four years old so he asked Ted what a yogurt store was. &quot;Yogurt is like ice cream,&quot; he told Paul, &quot;and I&#39;m going to get cherry.&quot; Paul said that he wanted cherry, too.   Then Ted walked over to the closet. He looked at his favorite shirt and pants to wear tomorrow. Then he looked at his shiny black pair of shoes. He smiled because he would have a nice shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes to wear for his birthday.  The two boys then heard the front door open and close. They raced down the stairs to greet their father. &quot;Daddy, I&#39;m ready for my birthday,&quot; Ted said. &quot;Me too,&quot; said Paul.

Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn&#39;t let her.

What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas.

      <t>Bob woke up to go to his first day of school on Monday. He woke up to his dog barking at him. His parents gave him a ride to school. When he arrived at school, he went to his first class which was gym class. In gym class, his gym teacher made him run laps around the track because he had been late to class. After he had ran his laps, he played baseball with his friends. Bob had wanted to play kickball or basketball, but his friends had chosen to play baseball. After gym class was over, he went to English class. In English class, he read a story about a lady who had fallen in love with a kitty. One day the kitty jumped out of the window in the lady&#39;s house and never came back. The lady was sad and wondered why her kitty would leave her. Bob was very moved by the story. After English class was over, he went to his third class of the day which was math. Bob kept quiet in his math class because he didn&#39;t know the answers to most of the questions the teacher was asking. After his math class, he went to the fourth and last class of the day which was arts and crafts. In arts and crafts, Bob painted a picture that he was very proud of. When art class was over, Bob was happy because he had finished his first day of school. He was excited to go to school on Tuesday and Wednesday.</t>

      <t>Once, there was a boy named Dan that was no older then seven or eight years old.

In fact they moved around a lot.  They have also lived in Georgia and California and this was the first time being stuck inside. It got so bad he was looking forward to going to school. This boy was an only child and was not allowed to go outside to play.  Instead he spent most of his time locked inside his house alone with no friends to play with.  One day he got a great idea.  Why don&#39;t I ask my mom, for a pet?  He thought long and hard.  I can get a dog or cat. I don&#39;t like birds, fish or hamsters. This way I&#39;ll always have a friend to play with when I&#39;m inside.  He thinks to run up to his mom and say mommy, mommy!  Can I get a new pet?

      <t>Once, there was a boy named Dan that was no older then seven or eight years old.  Dan lived with his mother Sam and father Spike in a small house in a dangerous neighborhood in New York city.  Before their move from Florida he spent most of his time outside at a park.

      <t>I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I&#39;m going to try and not let anyone else know that as I&#39;d rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn&#39;t want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I&#39;m happy we weren&#39;t told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.  Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!</t>

My name is Matt, but I&#39;m going to try and not let anyone else know that as I&#39;d rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn&#39;t want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I&#39;m happy we weren&#39;t told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.  Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!</t>

      <t>A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed. He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire. His stomach growled because there wasn&#39;t any dinner to eat tonight, but tomorrow would be a better day.</t>

      <t>One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day. The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever. After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked Sam about his knee. Sam told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down. Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like Sam more about their accidents. The doctor said, &quot;Wow Sam! It sounds like you had quite a fall.&quot; The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home. On the way out of the doctor&#39;s office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home.

      <t>One day, Jimmy, who was getting ready to walk down to school, could not find his favorite hat. He began looking all over the place for it, his room, the kitchen, even outside. It was nowhere to be found. He was running late for school and didn&#39;t want to be marked absent so he went to school without it. At school, Jimmy kept becoming upset because he couldn&#39;t find his hat. When Jimmy got home his hat was sitting there next to his goldfish. His mom had found it.

      <t>Dr. Curtis  On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family&#39;s farm.  Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.  When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.  Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn&#39;t wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. &quot;Bonnie is going to be alright,&quot; he said to Curtis.  &quot;Really?&quot; the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, &quot;I got to go check on her.&quot;   &quot;That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head,&quot; his father said as he smiled at Curtis.  Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie&#39;s eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.  Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, &quot;Everything looks okay, daddy.

      <t>Dr. Curtis  On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family&#39;s farm.  Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.  When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.  Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn&#39;t wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. &quot;Bonnie is going to be alright,&quot; he said to Curtis.  &quot;Really?&quot; the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, &quot;I got to go check on her.&quot;   &quot;That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head,&quot; his father said as he smiled at Curtis.  Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie&#39;s eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.

The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.

One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.</t>

      <t>Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane&#39;s favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close. But that didn&#39;t stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them. Jane liked being active.

      <t>Tiger was a pig. Tiger&#39;s aunt Tabby always took care of Tiger. All Tiger had to do was make an oink and Tabby would come running to check on Tiger. Sometimes Tiger got into fights with his brother Tom and Tabby always took Tiger&#39;s side. One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn&#39;t want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn&#39;t true, but Tom didn&#39;t want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special. When Tabby and Tom came home Leon left and Tom went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and Leon even took Tom to the moon. Tom was happy, because he got to see things that Tiger never got to see. They lived happily ever after.</t>

      <t>There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa&#39;s factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn&#39;t like making cake much. In fact, Isaac&#39;s dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn&#39;t look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.</t>

Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. Michelle said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs.

      <t>Michelle and Anthony were having lunch in the park with their mother. She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips. As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch. There was one family that had 3 dogs with them. The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people. Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy. Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. Michelle said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs.

She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.  She thought that wings would be too hard to make.  Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.  Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.  Allie looked in the refrigerator but there were no carrots.  She took some spinach instead.

      <t>In their small town there are not very many kids. Joe is 8 years old. Nate is 9 years old. They have been the only two boys since they were born. One day Joe saw a White moving truck down the street from his and Nate&#39;s tree house. Joe got really excited and told Nate about it. Nate and Joe waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The Boy&#39;s Club started when they were 6 and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  Joe and Nate both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. Nate started day dreaming about playing baseball. Joe started thinking about how fun football would be. They don&#39;t like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun&#39;s bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened Nate looked close and yelled out &quot;There are three boys&quot;!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. Nate broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. Joe started running to catch up to Nate. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as Nate and Joe both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later Nate stood up and said, &quot;Hi I&#39;m Nate and this is Joe. Do you want to join The Boy&#39;s Club&quot;? The boy said, &quot;Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too?

Nate and Joe waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The Boy&#39;s Club started when they were 6 and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  Joe and Nate both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. Nate started day dreaming about playing baseball. Joe started thinking about how fun football would be. They don&#39;t like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun&#39;s bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened Nate looked close and yelled out &quot;There are three boys&quot;!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. Nate broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. Joe started running to catch up to Nate. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as Nate and Joe both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later Nate stood up and said, &quot;Hi I&#39;m Nate and this is Joe. Do you want to join The Boy&#39;s Club&quot;? The boy said, &quot;Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too? And Joe said, &quot;YES!&quot; The boy took a step back and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m Jacob and my twin&#39;s name is Josh. We are 9 and our little brother is Alex.

Maybe that&#39;s why I feel so hungry.&quot;  But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn&#39;t feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.  She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.  Below the title, the cover said, &quot;Learn to live on vegetables!&quot;  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.  If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.  She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.  That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!  Millie wasn&#39;t sure if it would work this time, but the magazine&#39;s tips made her want to give it another try!</t>

Maybe that&#39;s why I feel so hungry.&quot;  But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn&#39;t feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.  She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.  Below the title, the cover said, &quot;Learn to live on vegetables!&quot;  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.  If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.  She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.  That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!  Millie wasn&#39;t sure if it would work this time, but the magazine&#39;s tips made her want to give it another try!</t>

      <t>Joe was moving to a different state. He wanted to make the move without spending much money. He thought about driving in his own vehicle, but didn&#39;t do that.

He brought his belongings to the company&#39;s location with the small truck. At the company&#39;s building, he packed his stuff into a trailer. After all his belongings were in the trailer, he sealed off the trailer with a wooden wall.   The company filled the rest of the trailer with their own stuff.

Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one. Amy&#39;s mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state. As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement. They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see. Amy&#39;s mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip. When they got on the plane, Amy became afraid.

      <t>Amy and David had been best friends since Kindergarten. They had become friends on the very first day, since both of them loved airplanes. David had made a paper plane for his friend Pete, but he let Amy play with it as much as she wanted. He ended up giving it to her and making a new one for Pete, and another for himself. To thank him, she made him a paper heart. When it was recess, they went outside and flew their planes high into the air. They laughed when David&#39;s plane landed on the teacher&#39;s head. She laughed too and gave David back his plane. Now that they are older, Amy and David are learning more about planes and flying. Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one. Amy&#39;s mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state. As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement. They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see. Amy&#39;s mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip. When they got on the plane, Amy became afraid. Her mother calmed her down and gave her a new doll to hold to help her feel safe. When the plane took off, Amy and David both shouted with happiness and watched out the windows. They watched the ground get smaller and smaller and finally disappear. They sat back in their seats, ready to enjoy the ride.</t>

On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and on the weekends, his master would even put him a plastic ball that allowed him to run all across the house, as long as he stayed in the ball.

He wanted to feel the rain on his fur, wanted to eat wild seeds that fell from the tree. He wanted to be free! He would watch the flowers come up in the spring from his window, and the snow fall in the winters, always wanting to know what the seasons felt like.    One Tuesday morning in the summer, Harry woke up to the sun shining down into his cage in the middle of the room that he stayed in. &quot;Today is the day I see the world!&quot; Harry yelled to himself. He waited for his master to put him in his plastic ball. He thought as long as he could make it to the door, he would be free.

      <t>Once upon a time there was a little elf named Boo.  Boo longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one.  Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish.  First he looked under his pillow.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the fridge.  No goldfish their either.  Frustrated, he went to his friend Miles.  Miles was an alligator.

First you must clap for me.&quot;  Boo clapped many times.  &quot;Now,&quot; spoke Miles, &quot;You must chirp like a young bird.&quot;  Boo chirped happily.    &quot;Last,&quot; said Miles, &quot;You must fold my laundry.  It is behind the wood pile.&quot;  Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry.  When he was all done he returned to Miles.  &quot;Miles,&quot; he asked, &quot;Where can I find a goldfish?&quot;  Miles smiled as he spoke, &quot;Fish swim, yes?  Look in a place with water.&quot;  Boo quickly returned home and began his hunt.  First he looked in his drink cup.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the toilet.  What he saw in the toilet surprised him.  There was a goldfish swimming in the toilet!  As it turned out, it was a very special goldfish.  The fish was a funny color.  It wasn&#39;t red.  It wasn&#39;t orange.  It wasn&#39;t green.  It was blue!  Boo named his goldfish Apple Cracker and they quickly became friends.</t>
      <h>Boo found the goldfish in under his pillow.</h>

      <t>Randan&#39;s parents surprised her one day by bring home a small bunny. This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it. After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play. That was when everything went wrong. After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off.  Later that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it. Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away. She said to herself that it could not have done it. The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan. Nothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night. This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was. When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry. The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger. The dad got some glue and made the bunny&#39;s butt stuck on the carpet.

All the strange things he ate made him very sick. After eating the chalk, his stomach made a weird noise as if it was trying to talk to him. Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things.   One day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala. Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that Tarwala&#39;s dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed Tarwala&#39;s mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.</t>

Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things.   One day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala. Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that Tarwala&#39;s dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed Tarwala&#39;s mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.</t>

      <t>There was once a young bear who lived in a small cave in the woods. His cave was comfy, warm, and dark, and had a bit of a yard in front of it. The bear lived with his mother and father, and spent his days walking around and his nights curled up asleep. He liked to look for berries to eat. His favorite berries were blueberries, but he would eat any berries he found: strawberries, raspberries, cherries, anything.  There was a river near the bear&#39;s cave, and he loved to sit on the bank and look at the fish and frogs, and at his own reflection in the water. One sunny afternoon, when he was looking into the river, he saw a family of ducks swimming by. He got up and followed them. They swam along in the river, and he walked along the bank. They traveled like this until they reached a small clearing in the forest. The bear stopped and looked around, and saw that the clearing was completely filled with blueberries -- more than he had ever seen!

      <t>There was once a young bear who lived in a small cave in the woods. His cave was comfy, warm, and dark, and had a bit of a yard in front of it. The bear lived with his mother and father, and spent his days walking around and his nights curled up asleep. He liked to look for berries to eat. His favorite berries were blueberries, but he would eat any berries he found: strawberries, raspberries, cherries, anything.  There was a river near the bear&#39;s cave, and he loved to sit on the bank and look at the fish and frogs, and at his own reflection in the water. One sunny afternoon, when he was looking into the river, he saw a family of ducks swimming by. He got up and followed them. They swam along in the river, and he walked along the bank. They traveled like this until they reached a small clearing in the forest. The bear stopped and looked around, and saw that the clearing was completely filled with blueberries -- more than he had ever seen!   The young bear ate his fill of blueberries, then took home as many as he could carry in his paws. He went to bed happy. It was a wonderful day.</t>

Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park.  This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with.  But Leah was scared of dogs.  Leah didn&#39;t see the dog at first.  Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah.  Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.  The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.  Leah was scared.  She started yelling and screaming.  This only made the dog look confused.  The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself.  They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling.

Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah.  Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.  The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.  Leah was scared.  She started yelling and screaming.  This only made the dog look confused.  The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself.  They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling.  Mommy went over and took Leah away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing.  The dog&#39;s master came and got the dog, and Leah went back to playing.  &quot;Some dogs are nice,&quot; Mommy told Leah.</t>

      <t>Bob and Sue were in class.  Bob was listening to the teacher.  Sue was looking out the window, thinking about what she would do during recess.  The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.  She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.  Then they could read more books.  The teacher thought reading was always a very fun activity. While thinking, Sue planned how she would climb the tall tree in the playground.  It had many low, thick branches.  She wanted to see what the yard looked like from up above.  She did not think reading was a very fun activity at all.  She would rather be outside.

      <t>I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.</t>

      <t>Once there was a turkey named Tim, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time. His favorite food would be corn, which he enjoys licking when it is still on the cob. But his parents spank him to try to get him to stop doing that, as he often burns his tongue when the cob is too hot. He enjoys watching football games as well, he always cheers and claps for his favorite team, the Gobblers. In a game he watched last week, the other team, a chicken team named the Clucks, were playing as well. It was a close game, but the Gobblers ended up winning with a little luck. Tim&#39;s best friend was also watching the game, Tony the lizard, and they both enjoyed watching the game together!</t>

Today he had to go to school and he wasn&#39;t very happy about that. After breakfast he walked to the bus stop. There he found his neighbor Ashley, who was also an evil superhero. John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing. John had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair. Now Ashley was screaming! John the superhero got in trouble for that.</t>

      <t>One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly. He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him. He looked around the rock, but couldn&#39;t see anything. Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy.   &quot;I wonder what&#39;s making that noise,&quot; Billy said. Beverly ate some grass. He went back home. Beverly followed him.  Billy asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. &quot;Use the spoon to dig under the rock,&quot; she said. &quot;Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you.&quot;  &quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Billy said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.  Then Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill.  &quot;Thank you, Beverly,&quot; Billy said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have done it without you.&quot;  Billy and Beverly looked where the rock had been. In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it. The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food. Billy went back home and told Judy, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.</t>

      <t>The kid was going for a quick swim. He loved to get out and hop back into the water. When he was out of the pool he liked to dance and run around. Sometimes when he got out he would sit in the chair and get some sun. He liked to work on his skin color. Just like his mommy. He would take his toys and hop in the water with them. He liked to play football in the water the most. He was taller than the other kids his age, so he could play football and not worry about the bigger kids. He could jump into the deeper section of the pool as long as he got back to where he could touch before his mom worried too much. The pool was his favorite place in the world. The boy could imagine he was doing anything. All of his problems went away. It was a very nice place for him to get his energy out and make friends for when he wasn&#39;t at the pool. He loved making friends.</t>

      <t>A boy named Pedro was walking down the street one day, and he met a pretty girl in a pink dress who handed him a bell. It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner. It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder.

Everybody is their own person, never be afraid to be who you are.&quot; Anne hugged her friend and placed her red ribbons back in her hair.</t>

      <t>Leah rides her bike  Leah was excited.  Today was her seventh birthday and she picking out her present.  It was a new pink bike with a basket and bell.  It was much prettier than her old red and white bike.  The bell on her old bike didn&#39;t ring, and the basket on that bike was torn.  The only problem was that Leah could not ride a bike yet.  Her old bike had training wheels, but her new one did not.    Leah wanted to ride her bike, but she was scared.

She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles. We all wore full black costumes every time we played.  &quot;What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time.&quot;   A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda. We hadn&#39;t seen each other since New York. Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn&#39;t remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore! It turns out; Matilda was also there to pick someone up from school.  &quot;Well, Sandra, why don&#39;t you join me and my grandson for lunch?

      <t>My name is Sandra. Let me tell you the story of the best meal I ever had.  I was sitting on the school bench outside Springfield Elementary School, waiting to pick up my granddaughter. She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles. We all wore full black costumes every time we played.  &quot;What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time.&quot;   A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet.

      <t>My brother Ryan is 12 years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn&#39;t see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan&#39;s visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday.

He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan&#39;s visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can&#39;t wait to see him again. Next time, we&#39;ll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.</t>

Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. &quot;Hi there, my name is Manny and I&#39;m a fox. Who are you?&quot; The frog on the log didn&#39;t answer at first. He finally said, &quot;My name is Tony and I&#39;m a frog. My brother could beat you up.&quot; Manny was very surprised to hear this. First, why would a frog&#39;s brother want to fight him? Second, how could some little frog beat him up? Manny told Tony he didn&#39;t think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him. Tony jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, &quot;You&#39;re a liar! My brother can beat up anyone!&quot; As the frog went away, Manny was very confused. He didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, but the frog was sad because of what Manny said. Manny also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog. He soon found out that Tony&#39;s brother was not from the same mother. His brother was a brown bear named Greg. After taking a good look at Greg, Manny said yes, Greg could beat up anyone he chose. After that day all three of them became close friends.</t>

They saw their friends Mary and her sister Melissa. Mary was dressed as a princess, like Grace. The two girls said hello and looked over each other&#39;s costumes. Grace had a purple dress with a pink hat; Mary had a pink dress with a purple hat. The two girls switched hats so their hats matched their costumes. They said goodbye and went on trick-or-treating.  Max and Grace walked up to the first house on their block and rang the doorbell. A large man dressed as a doggy opened the door and gave them a bunch of candy. They thanked him and moved on. The next house had a mummy standing on the front porch. They knew it was a costume, but they were too afraid to go up to him and ask for candy, so they moved on to the next house. After they had walked the whole neighborhood and filled their bags with candy, Grace and Max went home with their mother. They dumped the candy out on the dining room table and began to eat it. &quot;You had a nice Halloween, didn&#39;t you?&quot; their mother asked them. Max and Grace smiled and said yes, they had.</t>
      <h>Max&#39;s sister&#39;s was name Amy.</h>

He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob&#39;s job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm. Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.</t>

      <t>It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy Bob. He was riding around on his horse. It was a good animal, and its name was Steve. Steve was an old friend to Bob. He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob&#39;s job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm. Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.</t>

Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad&#39;s arms.  They both looked at it, and Albert&#39;s son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.

Because of that feeling, he picked up the phone and all of a sudden he passed out. When he woke up he was in a warmer place than before. He looked around and saw that he was on a small piece of land in the middle of the ocean. Its name was Otonga, but John didn&#39;t know that. He looked behind him and saw a forest and a big volcano. Next to him there was a cat named Bob. John felt happy to be in such a nice place. He got up. Bob ran away into the forest. John looked at the ocean, but he couldn&#39;t see anything else there. He followed Bob. After walking through the forest for a short time he got tired and sat down.</t>

On Tuesday, Greg&#39;s father helped them put the wheels on the racing car. His mother had to hold the car&#39;s body up when his father put the wheels on. On Wednesday, Greg and his mother colored in the number 8 on the car. This was Greg&#39;s lucky number! On Thursday, Greg and his mother tested the racing car at a park near the river. It went really fast! On Friday, Greg and his mother and father were outside in their backyard, still practicing with the racing car, making sure it went as fast as it could. Greg really wanted to win the race! On Saturday, Greg and his mother went to the race. It was being held on the track at his school. They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from 10. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO! Greg pushed his car forward as fast as he could!

The game ended with his home team winning by one run. The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away. On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner. When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing. After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert. His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake. He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that.

      <t>Joey went to a baseball game during the winter this year. He went by himself knowing he would enjoy the game much more than if he had gone with his friends Sam, Mark and David. His friends like to talk and hang out more than watch the game itself. The game was very exciting; Joey sat at the edge of his chair the whole game. The game ended with his home team winning by one run. The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away. On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner. When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing. After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert. His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake. He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that. On his way home he thought someone was tailing him so he turned off into a coffee store. When they drove by he went home.</t>
