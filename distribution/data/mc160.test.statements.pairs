      <t>Todd is a small boy in the town of Rocksville. Todd thinks his town is the best place in the world, and out of all the places in Rocksville, Todd loves to play in Lake Keet the most. Lake Keet is a small lake with fish, plants, and even little shells. Todd&#39;s favorite part was the big rock in the middle of the lake. Todd lives pretty close to the lake, so he gets to go there a lot, but could never to get to the rock in the middle. Todd&#39;s dad never lets him swim too far because Todd can&#39;t swim very well. During summer, Todd told his dad that he wanted to get to the rock before break ended. Todd&#39;s dad told him he had to try his hardest. If he did, then Todd&#39;s dad would watch him swim every day. If Todd wanted to try and get to the rock, his dad would follow him there to make sure he was safe. Todd&#39;s dad wrote this down in his notebook so he wouldn&#39;t forget. After a week, Todd made his first try to get to the rock, and his dad followed him like he said he would. Todd didn&#39;t make it to the rock before he got tired and had to turn around. He practiced even harder for the next two weeks and wanted to try again. So, a month after summer started, Todd tried to reach the rock again. This time, Todd gave it his all and got all the way to the rock.

It was bright and sunny, and jungle birds were singing with all the other jungle animals.  Little Mortamer and his parents quickly went back to their tree, only to find something very sad!

One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her.  She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces.  Even Jackson, Hannah&#39;s dog, was acting different.  Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah&#39;s father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move.  Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal.  Then, Hannah&#39;s mother explained that they were moving to Kenya.  Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there.  As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah&#39;s mother calmed her with a gentle touch.  Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah&#39;s mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes.

Jon was so excited he couldn&#39;t even sit still. When Jon&#39;s dad put the box down it began to move. Jon was a little scared but also really excited to see what was in the box. When Jon pulled open the top of the box a very small white dog, covered in black spots, jumped out of the box and into Jon&#39;s lap and began to lick his face. Jon was so excited, he named the dog Jack.</t>

She wanted to get some ice cream, but when she got to the truck she saw that she had no money.  She remembered then that she left it at home.

When she got home, she got her money and ran back the way she came to the ice cream truck, but it was gone.  Lucy was very sad.

      <t>The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn&#39;t try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that&#39;s why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!</t>

When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn&#39;t try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that&#39;s why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!</t>

He really liked Martha and he fed her some bread every morning. When he was done feeding Martha he would go and feed his best buddy ever, Sammy, a big hairy dog. Tommy really loved Sammy and hung out with him all day, every day. Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine. Tommy found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day. Off Tommy and Sammy went for the day. When they got to the fishing hole Sammy ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up. Tommy ran to see what Sammy had found. Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad.

So, he asked his mom to come help him out. First he got a doughnut. &quot;That&#39;s not good for you at all!&quot; said his mom.

This time, when Jim and Linda dropped Reggie off, Jim picked up mom&#39;s guitar and played us a song.  He was really good!  Then Jim and Linda sang a song for us.  I can see why Reggie misses them when they are gone.  They are so nice!  We give Reggie lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.  He likes our dogs and cats.  We have a big black dog named Able.  We have a little dog named Mudpuppy and we have a puppy named Goldberry.  We have two cats.  One of our cats is named Glitch.  She has lots of colors.  We also have a white kitten named Vex.  One of the best things about watching Reggie is that we know when Jim and Linda come home, Linda bakes us a cherry pie for taking care of Reggie.

      <t>This is the story of a young girl and her dog. The young girl and her dog set out a trip into the woods one day. Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl&#39;s dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog&#39;s surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods.</t>

      <t>It was very warm for February. Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. Dad was washing his car. When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair.  &quot;Can we pet her?&quot; Anna asked.  &quot;Be careful,&quot; Mom said. Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.  &quot;She&#39;s fat,&quot; John giggled.  &quot;She&#39;s not fat. She&#39;s pregnant,&quot; Mom told him.  &quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; John asked.  &quot;It means she&#39;s going to have kittens.&quot; Anna said. &quot;Can we keep her?&quot; Anna begged. &quot;Please?&quot;  Mom and Dad looked at each other.  &quot;We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here,&quot; Mom said. &quot;Long-haired cats give you rashes.&quot;  &quot;But you always said you wanted one,&quot; Dad told Mom. &quot;Short-haired cats don&#39;t bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let&#39;s send her over to your parents&#39; farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one.&quot;  The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone&#39;s excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens. Anna named her kitten Lucky, and John named his kitten Spike. The other two kittens, Butterscotch and Squeakers, stayed at Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s house, but Anna and John each got a kitten of their very own.</t>

      <t>Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom. They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened. Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages. There were even two baby monkeys!  The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage. The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls&#39; visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!</t>

The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls&#39; visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!</t>

      <t>Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer&#39;s horses slept.  But Cotton wasn&#39;t alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton&#39;s mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer&#39;s orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing.   &quot;What are you doing, Cotton?!&quot;   &quot;I only wanted to be more like you&quot;.   Cotton&#39;s mommy rubbed her face on Cotton&#39;s and said &quot;Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way&quot;. And with that, Cotton&#39;s mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton&#39;s fur was all all dry.   &quot;Don&#39;t ever do that again, Cotton!&quot; they all cried. &quot;Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn&#39;t want that!&quot;  Then Cotton thought, &quot;I change my mind.

His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him.  One day, Scoop&#39;s friend Scap, invited him over for a sleepover party. It sounded like so much fun, but Scoop was too embarrassed. He didn&#39;t want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he couldn&#39;t reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party  Scap was a really good friend and he knew that Scoop wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan.  That afternoon, Scap gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food. They then went to Scoop&#39;s house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along. He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.</t>

      <t>On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn&#39;t. The click of Sylvia&#39;s shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn&#39;t come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he&#39;d find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft &quot;click click click&quot; of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.</t>

He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat.

Sophie stepped into the shower feeling so tired. As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal. As Sophie sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she wasn&#39;t feeling like herself. She remembered that she didn&#39;t exercise the day before. She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games. Sophie knew that on days that she didn&#39;t exercise, she always felt bad the next day. Sophie thought for a second, and then looked at the clock. She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day. She put on her running shoes and went out the front door. After only a quick bit of exercise, Sophie was feeling much better. She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.</t>

There was also soda, cake and other snacks for everyone to enjoy. The party got started and everyone was having a very good time. They were swimming and playing and laughing. The best part of the party is when they played games in the pool that the girl&#39;s mom had come up with to keep the party interesting. At the end of the day, everyone went home and all that was left was to clean up the pool area. It was a wonderful party and all the kids were looking forward to the next time they could go to another pool party.</t>
      <h>Only 5 friends were invited to the party.</h>

On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don&#39;t remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.  When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast. I&#39;ll never forget what he said. &quot;Dear, I love burnt chicken breast.&quot;  Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt. He put his arms around me and said &quot;Dear, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she&#39;s real tired and a little burnt chicken breast never hurt anyone.&quot;</t>

The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn&#39;t find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.    There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris.   Cindy said, &quot;I am calling my mom to let her know that I&#39;m here.&quot;    Tony said, &quot;That&#39;s a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you&#39;re done?&quot;  Cindy said &quot;Sure!
