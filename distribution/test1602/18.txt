Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods. This family had always lived in the woods. Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town. The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children. The dad and his family had a good life. They never wanted for much. The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town. One day there came a nasty storm to the woods. This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city. Many homes were under water. The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back. The logs would be used to build a wall. The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find. In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.
