The Rover family goes to the park for a wonderful picnic. The Rovers are a family of dogs. Mommy Rover packs a lunch which includes lots of doggie treats like dog bones and chew sticks. Daddy Rover brings the dog toys - an old Frisbee and a shoe that can be used for some fun activities - so their puppies, Paulie and Lucky, have games to play. It is a bright sunny day at the dog park. Lots of other doggie families are also at the park enjoying the nice weather. The Rovers see their friends, the Fidos, and invite them to join them for lunch. The two families eat and play together. Afterwards, it's nap time for the pups. The adult dogs clean up the leftover food. They pack the extra food in doggie bags - and pack their baskets and head home. The day was a lot of fun for all the dogs. Next week they plan to go to the beach and they might invite the Fidos to join them again.
