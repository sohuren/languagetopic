A bunny named Mandy lived in a small forest outside of the city. Mandy lived with her mother, father, three sisters and two brothers under a huge old tree. They had lived there a long time and there was lots of food close to the home. Their favorite foods were carrots and lettuce which grew at the farm next to their home. She had some friends that were birds. They were robins. She did not like the unfriendly black birds. They were loud and would take her food if they could. She loved to play tag with her brothers and sisters and their friend Rocky. He was a squirrel. The creek had a waterfall, it was fun to play around. They would go to the creek for fresh water and sometimes to take a bath. When the frogs made noise the bunnies would laugh. They thought it was such a funny sound. When the bunnies found some wild strawberries they ate them. They thought they were great, but they did not care for the blueberries. There were a lot of big rocks that they played on and around.
