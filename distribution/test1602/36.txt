Rain, rain everywhere! Mary and June were best friends; they played together every day. One day when June came over to play it was raining. Mary told Jane that the rain was mean. "How is the rain mean?" asked June. "It's everywhere!" said Mary. "It's raining on the sidewalk, it's raining on the swings, it's raining on my outside toys! It's even raining on my dog Dean!" June started to giggle. Mary did not like the rain, and Mary did not like that June that rain was funny! "It's not funny!" said Mary. June stopped giggling. "Don't be silly, Mary. I don't think the rain is funny. I think that you are funny, Mary! The rain is not mean; it's helping the plants and trees stay alive." "Really?" said Mary. "How is the rain helping the plants and trees?" June went to her backpack and pulled out a big book, the front of the book had a picture on a tree. June used the book to show Mary how the rain was good for the earth. When they were done reading the book, Mary smiled. "I still don't like the rain, but I guess it's ok sometimes."
