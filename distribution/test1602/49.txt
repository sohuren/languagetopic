One day 3 friends went to a pool party that they had been excited about for a long time. The girl and her brother, who were having the party, had been planning the party for a few weeks. They had invited about 20 friends and today was the big day. The pool was decorated with balloons and there were party favors on the tables. There was also soda, cake and other snacks for everyone to enjoy. The party got started and everyone was having a very good time. They were swimming and playing and laughing. The best part of the party is when they played games in the pool that the girl's mom had come up with to keep the party interesting. At the end of the day, everyone went home and all that was left was to clean up the pool area. It was a wonderful party and all the kids were looking forward to the next time they could go to another pool party.
