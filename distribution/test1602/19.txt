One day a young boy went to visit a toy store. In the toy store the young boy found many fun toys. One toy that the boy really liked was a small blue toy truck. The small blue toy truck was a lot of fun to play with, and made a lot of funny noises. The young boy played with the toy truck for a long time, and then another little boy showed up and began to play with a little red car. The two boys ended up becoming friends and played with the toys for a long time. They ended up becoming good friends and had many play dates together over the months ahead. On one play date the two boys built a large tree house and called it the tree castle. They played for hours in the tree castle and always found something fun to do when they played together. They were glad that they met in the toy store and became life-long friends.
