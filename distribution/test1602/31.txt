The day was sunny and warm. The birds were chirping and dancing around happily. Ashley, the daughter of the dressmaker in town, was walking and whistling and enjoying the day, carrying her fishing pole. She was on her way to the creek to meet her friend Ethan to go fishing. She was so excited; she loved to fish! As she was walking she took a time out to smell the flowers. She chose to pick some for her mother. "Mom may be so happy." she said out loud. "Pleased with what?" she heard behind her. Ashley jumped, dropping the flowers. "Oh Ethan! Why did you do that?" she asked. "I'm sorry, I scared you" Ethan stated. "I didn't mean to, I was curious that's all." Ashley turned to Ethan "That's alright, I was picking flowers for my mom, let's go fishing before it's too late". Ashley and Ethan skipped off to the creek and had a wonderful time fishing. Even if they didn't catch anything.
