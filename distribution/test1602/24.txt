Once upon a time Jimmy had a mother who told him that he was good at music. Jimmy wanted to play music. He did not know which instrument to play, so he tried a piano first. The piano went like a sound. Then he tried a guitar. The guitar played. His brother told him that the piano was better to start, so Jimmy played the piano. He hammered on the keys. Jimmy's brother liked this, but mom did not like this. Jimmy tried playing very quiet. Jimmy's mom liked this, but Jimmy's brother did not like this. Jimmy tried playing in the middle. Jimmy liked this, and Jimmy's mom liked this, and Jimmy's brother liked this. It was great.
