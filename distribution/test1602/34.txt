Today is Tom's first day of school. He is very excited to go to school. He gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom. He brushes his teeth. He also brushes his hair. Tom grabs his backpack from the table. He then grabs his pencil and goes to the bus stop. Tom sat next to Jim on the bus. Jim is Tom's best friend. They have known each other since they were two years old. They got off the bus and got to school. Tom was so excited to get to school, he left his pencil on the bus. He had to ask Bethany for a pencil. Bethany did not have a pencil so he asked Dena. She gave him a pencil. He finished his work and the bell rang. His favorite part of school was recess. He bought a snack at recess then went to play. He had such a good time at recess he did not want the day to end. After school, Tom and Jim rode the bus home. He said bye to Jim and went inside. He was tired after a long day but was ready for school tomorrow.
