One day, Phoebe woke up and found that her house had been broken into. Her front door was wide open. She went into the living room and saw that her television set and stereo were missing. She checked the kitchen, but didn't find anything missing there except for a clock. Then she saw that her purse had been stolen too. She called the police to report what had happened. The police officer told her that there had been a lot of cases like this in her neighborhood lately, and they were looking for the criminals. Phoebe went into her bedroom and started to cry. She had no money to buy a new television set or stereo. She was scared that the robbers might try to break into her house again. She called her friend Mary and asked her what to do. Mary told Phoebe to change her front door lock right away. She said she knew a detective who could try to find the robber who had broken into her house. Phoebe thanked Mary, and said she felt safe knowing that there was someone who could help her catch the robber so he wouldn't do it again.
