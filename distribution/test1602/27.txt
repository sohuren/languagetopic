Today is Josh's birthday, so he invited all of his friends over for his party. Josh wanted it to be the best party ever, so he helped his mom plan it so it would be fun. They first picked that it would be a pool party, since they had a huge pool in their backyard. So they told everybody to wear their bathing suits. They went to the sports store and got a basketball hoop that they could put in the pool, so people could play water basketball. Then they went to the food store and picked out all of Josh's favorite foods. They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill. When it came time for the party, Josh's best friend Ryan was the first to get there. Soon, all of Josh's friends were there and everybody had a great time. The weather was perfect and the food was delicious. It was the best seventh birthday ever!
