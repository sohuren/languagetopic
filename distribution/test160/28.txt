Jenny and Katie were very happy.<s>
Their mom was taking them to the circus.<s>
She had told them about it on Tuesday.<s>
They were going on Saturday afternoon.<s>
Their dad said they had to do their chores Saturday morning first or they would not get to go.<s>
They were going to get up early and get them done.<s>
They had been looking forward to this for the last few days.<s>
They had told their grandma and grandpa all about it when they saw them on Wednesday.<s>
It was hard to sleep, they were so excited and could not wait to go.<s>
They could not wait to get an elephant ride.<s>
They did this last year and thought it was so fun.<s>
Jenny wanted to see the monkeys, too; they were her favorite.<s>
Katie couldn't wait to see the lions; she thought they were the best.<s>
