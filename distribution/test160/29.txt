Once upon a time there was a bird named Lily.<s>
She lived in a tree with her parents.<s>
One day Lily flew to her friend Molly's tree nest, but she didn't ask for her parents' permission.<s>
They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast.<s>
They played tag.<s>
They played hide and seek.<s>
They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest.<s>
Lily's parents started to get very worried when she didn't return home for dinner.<s>
They called neighbors and friends, and even called Molly but they didn't hear the phone ringing.<s>
It wasn't until Molly's mom called her down to eat that Lily saw that it was almost past dinner time.<s>
Lily told Molly she had to go home.<s>
When Lily got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her.<s>
Lily felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again.<s>
Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed.<s>
Lily went right to sleep.<s>
