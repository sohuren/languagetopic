Mortamer was a tree monkey who lived in the jungles of Brazil with his parents, and their pet snail, Johnson.<s>
They lived in a grass house built in the very tops of the trees, so high that they could see the whole jungle from their front porch.<s>
One day, Mortamer and his parents were outside hunting for food and the sky turned black!<s>
The sun was gone, hidden behind giant black clouds!<s>
Big winds shook the very trees of the forest, scaring poor little Mortamer who had turned 7 years old yesterday.<s>
Then, without warning, the sun was back!<s>
It was bright and sunny, and jungle birds were singing with all the other jungle animals.<s>
Little Mortamer and his parents quickly went back to their tree, only to find something very sad!<s>
Their poor little house lay on the ground, smashed to pieces!<s>
The wind knocked it down!<s>
Little Mortamer was very sad, and started to cry.<s>
His parents smiled, and started to pick up the pieces.<s>
Other monkeys came by to help, too.<s>
Soon everyone was fixing Mortamer's house, and he was a very happy monkey.<s>
