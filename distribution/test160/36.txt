Rain, rain everywhere!<s>
Mary and June were best friends; they played together every day.<s>
One day when June came over to play it was raining.<s>
Mary told Jane that the rain was mean.<s>
"How is the rain mean?"<s>
asked June.<s>
"It's everywhere!"<s>
said Mary.<s>
"It's raining on the sidewalk, it's raining on the swings, it's raining on my outside toys!<s>
It's even raining on my dog Dean!"<s>
June started to giggle.<s>
Mary did not like the rain, and Mary did not like that June that rain was funny!<s>
"It's not funny!"<s>
said Mary.<s>
June stopped giggling.<s>
"Don't be silly, Mary.<s>
I don't think the rain is funny.<s>
I think that you are funny, Mary!<s>
The rain is not mean; it's helping the plants and trees stay alive."<s>
"Really?"<s>
said Mary.<s>
"How is the rain helping the plants and trees?"<s>
June went to her backpack and pulled out a big book, the front of the book had a picture on a tree.<s>
June used the book to show Mary how the rain was good for the earth.<s>
When they were done reading the book, Mary smiled.<s>
"I still don't like the rain, but I guess it's ok sometimes."<s>
