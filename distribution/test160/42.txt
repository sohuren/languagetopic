The Rover family goes to the park for a wonderful picnic.<s>
The Rovers are a family of dogs.<s>
Mommy Rover packs a lunch which includes lots of doggie treats like dog bones and chew sticks.<s>
Daddy Rover brings the dog toys - an old Frisbee and a shoe that can be used for some fun activities - so their puppies, Paulie and Lucky, have games to play.<s>
It is a bright sunny day at the dog park.<s>
Lots of other doggie families are also at the park enjoying the nice weather.<s>
The Rovers see their friends, the Fidos, and invite them to join them for lunch.<s>
The two families eat and play together.<s>
Afterwards, it's nap time for the pups.<s>
The adult dogs clean up the leftover food.<s>
They pack the extra food in doggie bags - and pack their baskets and head home.<s>
The day was a lot of fun for all the dogs.<s>
Next week they plan to go to the beach and they might invite the Fidos to join them again.<s>
