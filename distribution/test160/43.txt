The king, Banton, stood over his men who were tired from fighting.<s>
The dragons were not as tired as the men.<s>
He could not let any more pain happen to his men.<s>
He ordered the men to run away.<s>
The men went to the village.<s>
"Everyone must run for the hills."<s>
Charlie, the purple dragon let out a roar, and sent fire into the sky from his mouth.<s>
"That's right!<s>
Run little man!<s>
Run!"<s>
Luna and Milkyway, the grey and black dragons, cheered and celebrated the win.<s>
The dragons went to the river and started eating berries, and fruits.<s>
"Now we celebrate!<s>
We have what we want!<s>
Now we won't be hungry anymore!"<s>
Charlie cheered.<s>
"Good things are sure to come from this win over the humans!"<s>
Luna, not so sure, watched the humans running for their lives.<s>
The villagers could only watch the dragons take food from their land, afraid.<s>
They went to pack their things.<s>
They would need to leave with the king, and his men.<s>
There would be no soldiers to protect them from the dragons.<s>
Men, women, and children all ran around in confusion trying to get away.<s>
Before long, the village was vacated.<s>
It was okay; the villagers found a new home in the hills.<s>
