A boy was trying to pick out what instrument that he wanted to play.<s>
His parents wanted him to pick a good one because playing an instrument was very important to them.<s>
So, the boy went to a music store with his parents.<s>
When he got there he didn't know where to start, so the boy walked up to the front and asked the man who worked there for help.<s>
First the worker brought the boy to a piano.<s>
"No way," said the boy, "that looks way too hard!"<s>
The worker laughed at this, and then brought out a guitar.<s>
The boy thought that guitars were too popular and wanted to play something that not many other people would play.<s>
Finally, the worker brought the boy to the drums.<s>
"That's it!<s>
That is a cool instrument that I could really get into."<s>
However, his mom wasn't so happy with this because she thought that he would be too loud.<s>
The boy's dad stepped in and talked her into it because he knew that if the boy liked what he did, he would do way better.<s>
Twenty years later, and the boy was the drummer in a band.<s>
It the most popular rock band in the world.<s>
