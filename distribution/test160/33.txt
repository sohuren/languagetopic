Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom.<s>
They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened.<s>
Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages.<s>
There were even two baby monkeys!<s>
The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage.<s>
The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them.<s>
Next, it was time to stop for ice cream.<s>
Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream.<s>
Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate.<s>
Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.<s>
The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area.<s>
They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck.<s>
The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them.<s>
Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes.<s>
Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues.<s>
Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself.<s>
After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!<s>
