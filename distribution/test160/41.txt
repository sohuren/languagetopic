Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton.<s>
Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept.<s>
But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no.<s>
She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters.<s>
All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton.<s>
But she was the only white one in the bunch.<s>
The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy.<s>
Being different made Cotton quite sad.<s>
She often wished she looked like the rest of her family.<s>
So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them.<s>
When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing.<s>
"What are you doing, Cotton?!"<s>
"I only wanted to be more like you".<s>
Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you.<s>
We would never want you to be any other way".<s>
And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water.<s>
When Cotton came out she was herself again.<s>
Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry.<s>
"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!"<s>
they all cried.<s>
"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"<s>
Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind.<s>
I like being special".<s>
