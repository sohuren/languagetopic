Little Tommy woke one morning to the sun shining and the birds singing.<s>
He had a bird that would sit outside his window that he named Martha.<s>
He really liked Martha and he fed her some bread every morning.<s>
When he was done feeding Martha he would go and feed his best buddy ever, Sammy, a big hairy dog.<s>
Tommy really loved Sammy and hung out with him all day, every day.<s>
Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine.<s>
Tommy found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day.<s>
Off Tommy and Sammy went for the day.<s>
When they got to the fishing hole Sammy ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up.<s>
Tommy ran to see what Sammy had found.<s>
Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad.<s>
Tommy laughed and laughed at Sammy and calmed him down then picked up the toad.<s>
Sammy was very interested and licked the toad.<s>
Sammy found a new friend.<s>
Tommy took the toad home with them and named him Zoe the Toadie.<s>
