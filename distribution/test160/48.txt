When Sophie woke up that morning, she had no idea where her day was going to take her.<s>
She rolled out of bed, turned off her alarm and stretched.<s>
She wasn't feeling like herself that morning, but she wasn't sure why.<s>
Sophie thought to herself, "I slept well, I ate good food yesterday, and yet I still felt strange".<s>
Sophie stepped into the shower feeling so tired.<s>
As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly.<s>
She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal.<s>
As Sophie sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she wasn't feeling like herself.<s>
She remembered that she didn't exercise the day before.<s>
She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games.<s>
Sophie knew that on days that she didn't exercise, she always felt bad the next day.<s>
Sophie thought for a second, and then looked at the clock.<s>
She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day.<s>
She put on her running shoes and went out the front door.<s>
After only a quick bit of exercise, Sophie was feeling much better.<s>
She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.<s>
