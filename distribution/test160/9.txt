Emily and her brother Matthew went outside to play.<s>
They brought their dog Bo with them, too.<s>
Bo was holding a bone in her mouth.<s>
Matthew threw a ball and Bo chased after it.<s>
Emily laughed as Bo ran away.<s>
Bo brought the ball back to Matthew.<s>
Then Bo barked.<s>
This time Emily threw the ball.<s>
She was younger than Matthew, so the ball did not go as far.<s>
Bo chased after the ball anyway, and Emily laughed again.<s>
Matthew smiled at his little sister.<s>
Bo ran back to Emily and dropped the ball at her feet.<s>
Then Bo wagged her tail and licked Emily's face.<s>
Emily giggled and scratched Bo's ears.<s>
Then Matthew and Emily's mother came outside holding a bar of soap.<s>
She told them that it was time for dinner and they had to come inside and wash their hands.<s>
Just then, Matthew and Emily's dad came home from work.<s>
Matthew and Emily ran to their dad.<s>
They all walked inside together and Bo followed them in.<s>
They would have to play ball tomorrow.<s>
