Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Scoop.<s>
He was a very friendly giraffe and he was cute, too.<s>
He had beautiful orange and yellow markings and he loved to play with his friends, but Scoop had a problem.<s>
His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him.<s>
One day, Scoop's friend Scap, invited him over for a sleepover party.<s>
It sounded like so much fun, but Scoop was too embarrassed.<s>
He didn't want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he couldn't reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party  Scap was a really good friend and he knew that Scoop wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan.<s>
That afternoon, Scap gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food.<s>
They then went to Scoop's house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along.<s>
He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.<s>
