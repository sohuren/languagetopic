The day was sunny and warm.<s>
The birds were chirping and dancing around happily.<s>
Ashley, the daughter of the dressmaker in town, was walking and whistling and enjoying the day, carrying her fishing pole.<s>
She was on her way to the creek to meet her friend Ethan to go fishing.<s>
She was so excited; she loved to fish!<s>
As she was walking she took a time out to smell the flowers.<s>
She chose to pick some for her mother.<s>
"Mom may be so happy."<s>
she said out loud.<s>
"Pleased with what?"<s>
she heard behind her.<s>
Ashley jumped, dropping the flowers.<s>
"Oh Ethan!<s>
Why did you do that?"<s>
she asked.<s>
"I'm sorry, I scared you" Ethan stated.<s>
"I didn't mean to, I was curious that's all."<s>
Ashley turned to Ethan "That's alright, I was picking flowers for my mom, let's go fishing before it's too late".<s>
Ashley and Ethan skipped off to the creek and had a wonderful time fishing.<s>
Even if they didn't catch anything.<s>
