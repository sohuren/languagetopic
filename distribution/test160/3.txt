Jon was very excited to go to the park.<s>
His dad always takes him to the park to play ball.<s>
He plays baseball with all his friends.<s>
When he got to the park Jon saw his friend Joe.<s>
Joe had brought his new puppy to the park.<s>
The puppy was very cute.<s>
It was a white dog with black spots.<s>
Jon really liked Joe's new dog, so did their other friends Janet and Jake.<s>
Jon jumped up and down and told his dad how cool the dog was.<s>
The next day when Jon's dad came home he had a brown box with him.<s>
He told Jon he had a surprise for him.<s>
Jon was so excited he couldn't even sit still.<s>
When Jon's dad put the box down it began to move.<s>
Jon was a little scared but also really excited to see what was in the box.<s>
When Jon pulled open the top of the box a very small white dog, covered in black spots, jumped out of the box and into Jon's lap and began to lick his face.<s>
Jon was so excited, he named the dog Jack.<s>
