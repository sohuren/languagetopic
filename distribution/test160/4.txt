A little girl named Sue and her brother Jason got a puppy for Christmas.<s>
Their mom knew they had wanted one for some time.<s>
Their mom told them they had to take care of the dog.<s>
They named the dog Roxy and went out and bought their new puppy bowls, leashes, a dog house, and food.<s>
They were so excited to finally have a dog of their own.<s>
Every day they would make sure they fed Roxy and took really good care of her.<s>
Sue really like brushing her hair and Jason really liked walking her.<s>
They loved their puppy.<s>
One day their puppy got out and ran away.<s>
They looked for Roxy all day.<s>
They were so sad.<s>
They felt as if they did not take good care of their new puppy and that is why their puppy left.<s>
Their mom told them that it would be okay and that they would put lost signs out for the puppy.<s>
Jason and Sue got crayons.<s>
Sue colored a picture of their new puppy.<s>
Jason then put their number on the sign.<s>
They then went down the block and hung pictures on poles and after getting all the signs out, they went home to wait to see if someone would call.<s>
It did not take long.<s>
They had a call that the puppy was found.<s>
It was their neighbor Henry.<s>
The puppy had followed him in as he was walking to his house.<s>
He had never seen the puppy before and knew it must be lost.<s>
Sue and Jason were so happy to have their puppy back.<s>
They went in the house, fed the puppy, and laid down to watch a movie.<s>
When their mom walked in to tell them to go to bed, they were both snuggled with the puppy, sound asleep.<s>
