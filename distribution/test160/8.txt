There once was a little old lady who had no friends.<s>
She rode her bike to and from the store and didn't say hello to anyone along the way.<s>
One day she saw a little girl crying in the street.<s>
No one else was around to take care of the girl so the little old lady stopped her bike and asked the girl, "What is wrong, Dear?"<s>
The little girl said, "I hurt my knee when I fell down!"<s>
"Oh dear!"<s>
cried the little old lady and bent down and looked at the girl's knee.<s>
"It looks to me like you have a scrape," she said.<s>
The little girl cried and the little old lady said, "Don't worry, all boo-boos hurt a little but it's the medicine that makes it go away."<s>
The little old lady bent down and blew on the girl's knee and whispered, "Go away, go away, no boo-boos here today!"<s>
The little girl smiled and that little old lady found her first friend.<s>
