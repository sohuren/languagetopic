One day, Phoebe woke up and found that her house had been broken into.<s>
Her front door was wide open.<s>
She went into the living room and saw that her television set and stereo were missing.<s>
She checked the kitchen, but didn't find anything missing there except for a clock.<s>
Then she saw that her purse had been stolen too.<s>
She called the police to report what had happened.<s>
The police officer told her that there had been a lot of cases like this in her neighborhood lately, and they were looking for the criminals.<s>
Phoebe went into her bedroom and started to cry.<s>
She had no money to buy a new television set or stereo.<s>
She was scared that the robbers might try to break into her house again.<s>
She called her friend Mary and asked her what to do.<s>
Mary told Phoebe to change her front door lock right away.<s>
She said she knew a detective who could try to find the robber who had broken into her house.<s>
Phoebe thanked Mary, and said she felt safe knowing that there was someone who could help her catch the robber so he wouldn't do it again.<s>
