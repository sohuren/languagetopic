Henry woke up one morning and looked out his window.<s>
To his surprise the ground was covered in white.<s>
He quickly ran downstairs and asked his mommy what the white stuff was.<s>
She told him with a smile that it was snow.<s>
Henry was not sure what snow was, but got excited when she told him that it meant that he did not have to go to school that day.<s>
Henry asked his mom if he could play in snow and she told him yes.<s>
She got him dressed in warm clothes and took him outside and taught him how to build a snowman.<s>
She also taught him how to sled down the small hill in their yard.<s>
Henry had so much fun that day he fell asleep early and had dreams about the fun white snow that fell that day hoping he could have fun the next day as well.<s>
