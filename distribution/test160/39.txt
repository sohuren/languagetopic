Julia gets an allowance from her parents every week for different chores she does every day.<s>
The big chore she must do is to feed the dog after school.<s>
Julia had a busy day at school and had many tests to complete.<s>
When she got home, she forgot to feed her dog, Buddy.<s>
Her parents had to feed the dog later.<s>
The next day, she forgot again.<s>
She saw her parents were feeding Buddy for her each night that she forgot to do it.<s>
Julia stopped doing her chore because she knew her parents would take care of it for her.<s>
Julia used her extra time to play every day after school.<s>
At the end of the week, Julia was excited.<s>
She had been wanting a new doll that had come out in the stores.<s>
Her friends all had them, and she wanted one, too.<s>
But at the end of the week, Julia didn't get an allowance.<s>
Her parents told her it was because she had not done her big chore all week, and had played instead.<s>
Julia did not get the toy she wanted that week.<s>
