A bunny named Mandy lived in a small forest outside of the city.<s>
Mandy lived with her mother, father, three sisters and two brothers under a huge old tree.<s>
They had lived there a long time and there was lots of food close to the home.<s>
Their favorite foods were carrots and lettuce which grew at the farm next to their home.<s>
She had some friends that were birds.<s>
They were robins.<s>
She did not like the unfriendly black birds.<s>
They were loud and would take her food if they could.<s>
She loved to play tag with her brothers and sisters and their friend Rocky.<s>
He was a squirrel.<s>
The creek had a waterfall, it was fun to play around.<s>
They would go to the creek for fresh water and sometimes to take a bath.<s>
When the frogs made noise the bunnies would laugh.<s>
They thought it was such a funny sound.<s>
When the bunnies found some wild strawberries they ate them.<s>
They thought they were great, but they did not care for the blueberries.<s>
There were a lot of big rocks that they played on and around.<s>
