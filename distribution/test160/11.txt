Kacey was a princess living in a magical kingdom with her parents and two little brothers.<s>
One day a monster bashed down the door to the castle when Kacey wasn't home and grabbed her youngest brother.<s>
"Give me your jewels or I eat him!"<s>
the monster yelled.<s>
Kacey's mom and dad called for the guards, but the monster bashed them down.<s>
"Give me my jewels!"<s>
the monster said.<s>
"Or I'll eat your other son too!"<s>
Kacey got home to see the big back of the monster in the door.<s>
"What do I do?"<s>
Kacey thought.<s>
Then she remembered a move she had seen a fighter use at the fair she had gone to.<s>
She also remembered she could lift a thousand pounds.<s>
"I know!"<s>
She ran up behind the monster, grabbed him around the waist and lifted.<s>
She picked the monster up into the air, then slammed him down on his head.<s>
He didn't move, and Kacey smiled at her parents.<s>
Then she saw their sad faces.<s>
Oh no!<s>
She had squashed her little brother.<s>
