The girl and her brother, who were having the party, had been planning the party for a few weeks.<s>
They had invited about 20 friends and today was the big day.<s>
The pool was decorated with balloons and there were party favors on the tables.<s>
There was also soda, cake and other snacks for everyone to enjoy.<s>
The party got started and everyone was having a very good time.<s>
