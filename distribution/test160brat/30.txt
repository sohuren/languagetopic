John was in the third grade, and nine years old.<s>
Every day he had to walk home from school.<s>
There were some kids in his class who were mean to him, and during the winter they would throw snowballs at him.<s>
John could have told the teacher, but one of the kids was a very pretty girl.<s>
She was mean, but John liked her because she was pretty and did not want her to get in trouble.<s>
One day, his teacher asked John to stay after class to wipe off the chalkboard and to empty the pencil sharpener.<s>
By the time he was done, the other kids had gone home.<s>
They could no longer throw snowballs at him.<s>
John did not mind helping out his teacher, and he soon stayed after class every day.<s>
John was not very good at math, and sometimes his teacher would help him when he stayed after school.<s>
She said if John could help her out for at least two weeks, he could pass his math class.<s>
John thought it was a good deal, and ended up being much better at math.<s>
