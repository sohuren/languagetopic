There once was an elephant named Ellie.<s>
She really liked to eat peanuts.<s>
She lived with a circus and performed with clowns.<s>
One day she was really hungry and could not find any peanuts.<s>
She asked the lion, "Do you have any peanuts?"<s>
The lion said, "Sorry, I don't like peanuts, but the squirrel may have some."<s>
Ellie went looking for the squirrel and along the way saw a little girl.<s>
The little girl was crying.<s>
Ellie asked the little girl, "Why are you crying?"<s>
The little girl, Ava, said, "I lost my parents!"<s>
The elephant put Ava on her back and said, "I can help you look for them."<s>
They looked high and low for Ava's parents.<s>
Ellie made a loud sound with her nose and Ava's parents came to see what it was!<s>
Her parents were so happy to find Ava and so was Ellie.<s>
Ellie's stomach began to growl and Ava heard it.<s>
She dug into her parent's bag and brought out a bag of peanuts!<s>
Ellie ate the peanuts and everyone lived happily ever after.<s>
