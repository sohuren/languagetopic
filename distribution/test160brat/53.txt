Jamal made his mommy a special card for her birthday.<s>
When he gave it to her, she smiled and said that it was beautiful.<s>
His dad also gave her a card, but she did not smile the same way.<s>
Mommy didn't look mad, but Jamal knew that she was disappointed.<s>
The next day, Jamal's dad drove him to school.<s>
Jamal said "Daddy, did Mommy not like your birthday card?"<s>
Jamal's dad said, "Well, son, sometimes I don't know what your mother likes.<s>
I could have asked her or thought of something better."<s>
Before Jamal got out of the car, he asked his dad, "Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?"<s>
"Sure, that sounds good to me," said Jamal's dad.<s>
After school, Jamal and his dad went to the ice cream shop.<s>
Jamal said, "Now we can get Mommy the present!"<s>
Jamal's dad said, "What present?<s>
Did you have a secret plan?"<s>
Jamal giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.<s>
Jamal remembered that when Mommy took him to his grandma's house, she told Grandma that she always wanted to have a lily plant.<s>
They found a lily plant in the store.<s>
The woman who worked at the store asked, "Do you want to put this in a pot?"<s>
Jamal's dad told Jamal, "Let's get the yellow pot, because that's Mommy's favorite color."<s>
When they got home, Jamal's mommy came out of the kitchen.<s>
She saw the lily in the bright yellow pot on the table.<s>
Jamal saw her smile, only this time it was the same smile he saw when he gave her the card.<s>
Jamal smiled too because he knew that Daddy made her very happy.<s>
