Today is Josh's birthday, so he invited all of his friends over for his party.<s>
Josh wanted it to be the best party ever, so he helped his mom plan it so it would be fun.<s>
They first picked that it would be a pool party, since they had a huge pool in their backyard.<s>
So they told everybody to wear their bathing suits.<s>
They went to the sports store and got a basketball hoop that they could put in the pool, so people could play water basketball.<s>
Then they went to the food store and picked out all of Josh's favorite foods.<s>
They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill.<s>
When it came time for the party, Josh's best friend Ryan was the first to get there.<s>
Soon, all of Josh's friends were there and everybody had a great time.<s>
The weather was perfect and the food was delicious.<s>
It was the best seventh birthday ever!<s>
