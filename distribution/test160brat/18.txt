Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods.<s>
This family had always lived in the woods.<s>
Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town.<s>
The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children.<s>
The dad and his family had a good life.<s>
They never wanted for much.<s>
The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town.<s>
One day there came a nasty storm to the woods.<s>
This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city.<s>
Many homes were under water.<s>
The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back.<s>
The logs would be used to build a wall.<s>
The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find.<s>
In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.<s>
