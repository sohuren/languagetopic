One day, Lucy was taking her dog to the park when she saw a big ice cream truck.<s>
It did not look like other ice cream trucks she had seen before, so she rushed to look at it.<s>
Inside, she saw that this truck had many different flavors of ice cream that the other trucks didn't have.<s>
This truck had chocolate, strawberry, banana and even mint flavors!<s>
She wanted to get some ice cream, but when she got to the truck she saw that she had no money.<s>
She remembered then that she left it at home.<s>
All the other children were going up to the truck, but Lucy couldn't because she had no money.<s>
She rushed home with her dog at her side, and jumped across fences and ran across sidewalks as quickly as she could, trying her hardest to get home.<s>
When she got home, she got her money and ran back the way she came to the ice cream truck, but it was gone.<s>
Lucy was very sad.<s>
She went back home and...  ...found that her Mom had bought ice cream for everyone!<s>
