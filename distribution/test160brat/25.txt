It was very warm for February.<s>
Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather.<s>
Dad was washing his car.<s>
When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags.<s>
They ran to the garage to help her.<s>
But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair.<s>
"Can we pet her?"<s>
Anna asked.<s>
"Be careful," Mom said.<s>
Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.<s>
"She's fat," John giggled.<s>
"She's not fat.<s>
She's pregnant," Mom told him.<s>
"What's that mean?"<s>
John asked.<s>
"It means she's going to have kittens."<s>
Anna said.<s>
"Can we keep her?"<s>
Anna begged.<s>
"Please?"<s>
Mom and Dad looked at each other.<s>
"We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said.<s>
"Long-haired cats give you rashes."<s>
"But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom.<s>
"Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away.<s>
Let's send her over to your parents' farm.<s>
She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."<s>
The kids were excited.<s>
They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day.<s>
Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair.<s>
Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens.<s>
Anna named her kitten Lucky, and John named his kitten Spike.<s>
The other two kittens, Butterscotch and Squeakers, stayed at Grandma and Grandpa's house, but Anna and John each got a kitten of their very own.<s>
