Shelly wanted a puppy.<s>
She asked her mommy and daddy every day for one.<s>
She told them that she would help take care of the puppy, if she could have one.<s>
Her mommy and daddy talked it over and said that they would get Shelly a new puppy.<s>
Her mommy took her to the dog pound so that she could choose one that she wanted.<s>
All the puppies at the dog pound need a loving home.<s>
Shelly went to every cage and looked each puppy in the eyes and talked to each one.<s>
After each one, she told her mommy, "No, this isn't the one for me."<s>
Finally, she saw a black and white spotted one that she fell in love with.<s>
She screamed, "Mommy, this is the one!"<s>
Her mommy asked the worker to take the puppy out so that Shelly could make sure.<s>
Shelly and the puppy fell in love with each other right away.<s>
Shelly and her mommy took the black and white spotted puppy home with them.<s>
Shelly was so excited that she talked all the way home.<s>
After thinking hard, Shelly had a name for her new puppy, Spot.<s>
Now, Shelly has a new best friend and they play together every day when Shelly gets home from school.<s>
