Jim and Linda are our neighbors.<s>
Jim and Linda have an old dog named Reggie.<s>
We love our neighbors.<s>
They are like the perfect grandparents.<s>
We watch Reggie for them when they go out of town to see their children and grandchildren.<s>
Reggie is so fun to have around.<s>
He is 14 years old.<s>
We have 3 other dogs and Reggie is older than all of them.<s>
They all listen to what Reggie tells them to do.<s>
It is fun to see them respect him.<s>
We are watching Reggie now.<s>
He is staying with us for 3 weeks.<s>
He likes to go for rides in the car.<s>
He likes to go for walks.<s>
This time, when Jim and Linda dropped Reggie off, Jim picked up mom's guitar and played us a song.<s>
He was really good!<s>
Then Jim and Linda sang a song for us.<s>
I can see why Reggie misses them when they are gone.<s>
They are so nice!<s>
We give Reggie lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.<s>
