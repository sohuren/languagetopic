Hannah Harvey was a ten year old that had many friends in school.<s>
She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer.<s>
One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her.<s>
She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces.<s>
Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different.<s>
Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange.<s>
Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move.<s>
Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal.<s>
Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya.<s>
Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there.<s>
As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch.<s>
Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother.<s>
Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes.<s>
She did not know the next time she would be home.<s>
She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan.<s>
Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was, but promised to visit Hannah.<s>
The next day, Hannah boarded a plane with her family.<s>
At first, they thought that Jackson could not come with them.<s>
However, Hannah worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come.<s>
After he had them all, the airport said it was OK for Jackson to come!<s>
The Harvey family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in Kenya.<s>
