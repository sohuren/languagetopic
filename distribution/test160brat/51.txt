When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us.<s>
And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work.<s>
On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad.<s>
I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school.<s>
I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.<s>
When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast.<s>
I'll never forget what he said.<s>
"Dear, I love burnt chicken breast."<s>
Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt.<s>
He put his arms around me and said "Dear, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she's real tired and a little burnt chicken breast never hurt anyone."<s>
