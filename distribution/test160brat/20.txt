One day a boy was looking for a school lunch in the fridge.<s>
He was looking for something that was good for him, but also something that tasted good.<s>
He was going to school, and needed something to keep him going and doing well in class.<s>
Recently he had been eating cookies for lunch, and was tired by the end of the day.<s>
The cookies came from the school lunchroom, and his mom didn't know about them.<s>
Finally he got tired of cookies and thought he needed something good for him.<s>
So, he asked his mom to come help him out.<s>
First he got a doughnut.<s>
"That's not good for you at all!"<s>
said his mom.<s>
So, his mom got a big bag of broccoli.<s>
"Yuk, I hate the taste of broccoli," said the boy.<s>
They looked and looked and couldn't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him.<s>
Finally, they saw the perfect thing: some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend.<s>
It was so delicious the first time, and it tasted great cold for lunch.<s>
The chicken had the types of food he needed to get through the day.<s>
