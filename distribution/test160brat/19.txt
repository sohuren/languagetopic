One day a young boy went to visit a toy store.<s>
In the toy store the young boy found many fun toys.<s>
One toy that the boy really liked was a small blue toy truck.<s>
The small blue toy truck was a lot of fun to play with, and made a lot of funny noises.<s>
The young boy played with the toy truck for a long time, and then another little boy showed up and began to play with a little red car.<s>
The two boys ended up becoming friends and played with the toys for a long time.<s>
They ended up becoming good friends and had many play dates together over the months ahead.<s>
On one play date the two boys built a large tree house and called it the tree castle.<s>
They played for hours in the tree castle and always found something fun to do when they played together.<s>
They were glad that they met in the toy store and became life-long friends.<s>
