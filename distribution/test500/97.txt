Tarwala was a strange boy.<s>
He liked to eat anything that was put in front of him, even if it wasn't food.<s>
As a child he ate chalk sticks thinking it was candy.<s>
All the strange things he ate made him very sick.<s>
After eating the chalk, his stomach made a weird noise as if it was trying to talk to him.<s>
Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things.<s>
One day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats.<s>
His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem.<s>
His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it.<s>
One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala.<s>
Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened.<s>
Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out.<s>
It turns out that Tarwala's dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month.<s>
The stink was so powerful that it got magical.<s>
The magical stink changed Tarwala's mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food.<s>
Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.<s>
