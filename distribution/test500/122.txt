My name is Sandra.<s>
Let me tell you the story of the best meal I ever had.<s>
I was sitting on the school bench outside Springfield Elementary School, waiting to pick up my granddaughter.<s>
She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades.<s>
To pass the time, I played my triangle.<s>
In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles.<s>
We all wore full black costumes every time we played.<s>
"What lovely triangle music!<s>
You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time."<s>
A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!<s>
She was holding a trumpet.<s>
It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda.<s>
We hadn't seen each other since New York.<s>
Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn't remember what I looked like!<s>
We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore!<s>
It turns out; Matilda was also there to pick someone up from school.<s>
"Well, Sandra, why don't you join me and my grandson for lunch?<s>
There is a lovely Thai place right down the road.'<s>
We went there with my granddaughter and her grandson, and had a delicious meal.<s>
Our grandchildren got married 15 years later.<s>
