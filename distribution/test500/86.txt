Amy and David had been best friends since Kindergarten.<s>
They had become friends on the very first day, since both of them loved airplanes.<s>
David had made a paper plane for his friend Pete, but he let Amy play with it as much as she wanted.<s>
He ended up giving it to her and making a new one for Pete, and another for himself.<s>
To thank him, she made him a paper heart.<s>
When it was recess, they went outside and flew their planes high into the air.<s>
They laughed when David's plane landed on the teacher's head.<s>
She laughed too and gave David back his plane.<s>
Now that they are older, Amy and David are learning more about planes and flying.<s>
Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one.<s>
Amy's mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state.<s>
As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement.<s>
They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see.<s>
Amy's mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip.<s>
When they got on the plane, Amy became afraid.<s>
Her mother calmed her down and gave her a new doll to hold to help her feel safe.<s>
When the plane took off, Amy and David both shouted with happiness and watched out the windows.<s>
They watched the ground get smaller and smaller and finally disappear.<s>
They sat back in their seats, ready to enjoy the ride.<s>
