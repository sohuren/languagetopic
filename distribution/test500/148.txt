Greg and his mother were building a racing car.<s>
They were going to enter it into a race on Saturday.<s>
They began building the racing car on Monday.<s>
First, they had to build the body of the car.<s>
Greg wanted it to look like a strawberry!<s>
So they colored it red and put little dots all over it.<s>
On Tuesday, Greg's father helped them put the wheels on the racing car.<s>
His mother had to hold the car's body up when his father put the wheels on.<s>
On Wednesday, Greg and his mother colored in the number 8 on the car.<s>
This was Greg's lucky number!<s>
On Thursday, Greg and his mother tested the racing car at a park near the river.<s>
It went really fast!<s>
On Friday, Greg and his mother and father were outside in their backyard, still practicing with the racing car, making sure it went as fast as it could.<s>
Greg really wanted to win the race!<s>
On Saturday, Greg and his mother went to the race.<s>
It was being held on the track at his school.<s>
They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from 10.<s>
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO!<s>
Greg pushed his car forward as fast as he could!<s>
It reached the finish line before everyone else!<s>
Greg won the race!<s>
