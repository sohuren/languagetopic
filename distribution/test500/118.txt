Leah rides her bike  Leah was excited.<s>
Today was her seventh birthday and she picking out her present.<s>
It was a new pink bike with a basket and bell.<s>
It was much prettier than her old red and white bike.<s>
The bell on her old bike didn't ring, and the basket on that bike was torn.<s>
The only problem was that Leah could not ride a bike yet.<s>
Her old bike had training wheels, but her new one did not.<s>
Leah wanted to ride her bike, but she was scared.<s>
Daddy told her, "Leah, everyone is scared at first, but once you try, you are going to learn and stop being scared."<s>
Leah watched her friends riding their bikes.<s>
First Owen rode by the house and back up the street.<s>
Then along rode Dulce and Ruby.<s>
Leah was sad.<s>
She wished she could go riding with them.<s>
Leah finally chose to learn to ride her bike.<s>
She put on a helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.<s>
She was ready for battle!<s>
Mommy and Daddy went out with Leah and watched her start to pedal down the street.<s>
After a small bit, the bike tipped over.<s>
She sat on the road looking sad.<s>
She looked so cute sitting there that Daddy wanted laugh, but instead said, "Leah, you can do it.<s>
Go again."<s>
Leah tried several more times, and soon was riding!<s>
She went down the street and back again.<s>
Here came her friends with their bikes.<s>
Leah shouted, "wait for me," and joined them riding down the street.<s>
