David and Lucy waited in their mom's truck.<s>
They all were going to the circus to see the clowns.<s>
Their Mom had to take their little brother back into the house to get more diapers and go to the bathroom.<s>
David was worried because he did not want to miss the wolf clown.<s>
Lucy watched her brother rub his chin.<s>
"Why are you looking out the window?"<s>
she asked.<s>
"Mom needs to hurry.<s>
We might miss the clowns."<s>
"I am going to get out of the truck and draw triangles in the sand."<s>
Lucy said.<s>
"No!<s>
You might make us miss it."<s>
David cried.<s>
Before she could get out of the truck Lucy saw her mom and little brother walk out of the house.<s>
Her mom got in the truck and asked, "Okay kids are we ready to go?"<s>
David and Lucy yelled, "Yes!"<s>
When they got to the circus David and Lucy saw all the clowns.<s>
Their little brother was too young to go into the tent, so their mom stayed with him.<s>
The show ended and they walked to the truck.<s>
"What do you have there?"<s>
David asked Lucy "It is a bag I found in the tent."<s>
Lucy said.<s>
"We have to return that Lucy."<s>
Their mom said.<s>
"Why?<s>
It has cool stuff in it.<s>
I found it."<s>
Lucy said.<s>
"It is not ours."<s>
Their mom said.<s>
Lucy frowned as they walked to the lost and found and gave the bag back.<s>
Then they all went home.<s>
When they were washing up to go to bed Lucy said, "I fear some of those clowns.<s>
The wolf one was scary."<s>
"Lucy, I can save you.<s>
The wolf clown was a person in make-up."<s>
With that they shut off the bathroom light and went to bed.<s>
A great day had by all.<s>
