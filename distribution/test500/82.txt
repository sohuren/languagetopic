There once was a clown named Happy who traveled with the circus.<s>
He was one of the most famous clowns of all time, because he was once the star of a movie.<s>
Happy did a lot of things in his act that were very silly.<s>
He was best known for belting out songs in the wrong key, which would make neighborhood cats meow and howl.<s>
Happy would do other funny things in his act, like wrestle a big plastic alligator with tape over its mouth.<s>
He would also throw buckets of water at the people watching the circus, wetting all the people in the front seats.<s>
One day, a driver in the circus needed to brush his teeth because he had been eating popcorn all day.<s>
He was out of toothpaste, so he went to ask Happy if he could borrow some.<s>
Happy was eating a brownie, and his mouth was very full.<s>
When he tried to talk, he sounded sillier than ever.<s>
The driver laughed and asked Happy to point to the toothpaste.<s>
Happy pointed over to the sink, and the driver picked up the toothpaste and left.<s>
The driver didn't know that it was trick toothpaste that was pumpkin flavor.<s>
The driver hated pumpkin flavor!<s>
It tasted so bad.<s>
So he took the toothpaste and put it back on Happy's sink.<s>
He never borrowed Happy's toothpaste ever again.<s>
