The room had a high ceiling and white walls.<s>
The lunch was in the center of the room on a stand.<s>
The hamster was the first to see the lunch and ran over to it.<s>
"What a delicious lunch," he said, "I wish there was something for me to eat it with!"<s>
The hamster heard a noise in the corner and jumped up to look and see what it was.<s>
It was piggy.<s>
"Why do you need something to eat it with?"<s>
Piggy asked, "I roll around in my food and that works out well for me."<s>
"I was taught better manners than that," said the hamster, "I would at least like to find a fork to eat with."<s>
"I've heard they have forks in the farmhouse," said Piggy.<s>
"The farmers and their kids eat with them all the time.<s>
If you want, you can climb on my back and we can make a trip to the farmhouse together."<s>
The hamster and Piggy set off on their trip.<s>
