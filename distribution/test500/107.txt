Once there was a turkey named Tim, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time.<s>
His favorite food would be corn, which he enjoys licking when it is still on the cob.<s>
But his parents spank him to try to get him to stop doing that, as he often burns his tongue when the cob is too hot.<s>
He enjoys watching football games as well, he always cheers and claps for his favorite team, the Gobblers.<s>
In a game he watched last week, the other team, a chicken team named the Clucks, were playing as well.<s>
It was a close game, but the Gobblers ended up winning with a little luck.<s>
Tim's best friend was also watching the game, Tony the lizard, and they both enjoyed watching the game together!<s>
