Oil is plentiful in West Texas.<s>
When people think of West Texas they think of these machines called "pump-jacks."<s>
A pump-jack is a machine that pulls Oil out of the Earth.<s>
Robert's job is to fix pump-jacks.<s>
So he travels to West Texas to see if he can help.<s>
Steve owns many pump-jacks and is having a very tough time keeping them working.<s>
During the summer in West Texas the temperature can be over 100, which causes these machines to break often.<s>
Robert runs into Steve at a restaurant on a very hot day.<s>
After they talked about the weather for a few seconds, Steve says "my machines keep breaking because of this heat!"<s>
Robert says "Steve, I think you and I are both in luck because I fix pump-jacks."<s>
Immediately, they both travel out to Steve's land and Robert gets to work!<s>
