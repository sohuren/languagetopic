Joe was in his bedroom.<s>
He was reading a book that his teacher gave him.<s>
The book was titled, "Everything You'd Want to Know About Fish."<s>
He was reading the book because he was interested in learning more about fish.<s>
Joe thought reading the book was fun.<s>
He liked to imagine himself swimming with fish he read about in the book.<s>
Also, he liked looking at the pictures.<s>
Joe's mother called him.<s>
Joe closed the book, and went downstairs.<s>
He asked his mother, "Do you need something?"<s>
And his mother said, "Joe, it's time for dinner."<s>
