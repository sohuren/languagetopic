One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients.<s>
She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.<s>
"I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt.<s>
I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.<s>
"Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.<s>
"Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.<s>
"Don't talk back, kids.<s>
Do what I said and head into town.<s>
It's a beautiful day.<s>
Go the long way and follow the river until you get there.<s>
Don't take the short way through the forest.<s>
A lion has escaped from the zoo.<s>
He might be hiding in the forest."<s>
So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them.<s>
Instead they took the short way through the forest.<s>
"I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John.<s>
"Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again.<s>
If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."<s>
So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another.<s>
But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar.<s>
It was the lion!<s>
Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.<s>
"We're sorry!"<s>
they both said to their mother.<s>
"We'll never be disobedient again!"<s>
And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.<s>
