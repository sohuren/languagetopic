I was really scared walking into school today.<s>
It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year.<s>
My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself.<s>
I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today.<s>
Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought.<s>
I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call.<s>
She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now.<s>
Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly.<s>
As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.<s>
Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began.<s>
When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together.<s>
It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end.<s>
Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!<s>
