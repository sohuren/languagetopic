The grass was wet with as it always was in the early morning.<s>
This made Angelica very happy.<s>
It meant she was up early enough to get to the phone store in time to get the special new phone before anyone else.<s>
She brushed her hair and threw on her clothes.<s>
She was ready.<s>
She would make it there on time.<s>
She started her way down the stairs and ran into her grandmother.<s>
Her grandmother was always up early.<s>
She wished her a good morning before she rushed out the door.<s>
She almost fell over her younger brother's seesaw as she came out the door.<s>
This was because she was in such a rush.<s>
She moved it out of the pathway.<s>
She grinned as her friend's car pulled up in front of her house.<s>
They made their way to the store and found out they were not the first one there.<s>
There was ten people in line before them.<s>
Angelica was kind of disappointed, but too excited to get her new phone to care.<s>
