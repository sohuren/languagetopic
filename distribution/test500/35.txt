Today was the Moon's birthday, and Ms. Star wanted to be sure to get the best gift ever for her friend Moon.<s>
She had no idea what she was going to get him!<s>
A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that Moon had one too.<s>
Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon.<s>
She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon.<s>
"Oh, I think I'm going to get Moon a space puppy.<s>
He was talking about how much he loved dogs!"<s>
That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. Star, but since Saturn was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. Star couldn't do it too!<s>
"Try asking Mars."<s>
said Saturn.<s>
"He might know what to get Moon."<s>
Ms. Star asked Mars.<s>
"Well," said Mars.<s>
"I know that I'm getting Moon a space ship, and that Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are going together to get Moon a new house."<s>
"Wow!"<s>
said Ms. Star.<s>
"How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?"<s>
Mars thought about it for a little bit.<s>
"Hmm."<s>
he said.<s>
"Maybe you could make him something?"<s>
"What a great idea!"<s>
said Ms. Star.<s>
"I know what would be perfect to make for him!"<s>
That night, at Moon's birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts.<s>
"It's the perfect gift!<s>
Thank you so much Ms. Star!"<s>
He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust.<s>
"It's so cold here in space!<s>
A sweater is the best gift ever!"<s>
