There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.<s>
Her name was Tori.<s>
Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.<s>
One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.<s>
Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.<s>
As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.<s>
Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.<s>
She had never been on the street by herself before.<s>
Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.<s>
She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.<s>
All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.<s>
She was lost and confused.<s>
Poor Tori didn't know what to do!<s>
The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said "Animal Control".<s>
Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.<s>
Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.<s>
She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.<s>
She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.<s>
After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.<s>
He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.<s>
Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.<s>
She was so happy to see her puppy again.<s>
Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.<s>
