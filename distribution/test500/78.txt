Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.<s>
Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.<s>
"Hmm," she had thought.<s>
"Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.<s>
Maybe that's why I feel so hungry."<s>
But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.<s>
She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.<s>
Below the title, the cover said, "Learn to live on vegetables!"<s>
She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.<s>
If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.<s>
She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.<s>
That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!<s>
Millie wasn't sure if it would work this time, but the magazine's tips made her want to give it another try!<s>
