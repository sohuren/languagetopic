Susie the spider was a small little spider.<s>
Her brother Steve was bigger than her.<s>
Her mother Sally was even bigger than Steve.<s>
Her father Stewart was bigger than Steve too, but wasn't the biggest spider of the family.<s>
When Susie got mad, she would kick her brother Steve.<s>
Even if Steve was bigger than Susie he would yell and run away.<s>
Steve was always getting mad at Susie, because she got all the attention.<s>
Even when Steve would do all the washing, sweep the floor and clean the sink, still he didn't get any attention.<s>
All Sally had to do was suck her thumb and look cute.<s>
Sally was better at reading than Steve and he thought this was why he didn't get as much attention.<s>
Susie was younger, but smarter than Steve.<s>
Steve didn't think this was fair, because even if he wasn't as smart, he worked hard and was always a good spider.<s>
