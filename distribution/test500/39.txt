Marvin woke up on Monday morning.<s>
He yawned and stretched and got out of bed to go to the bathroom.<s>
When he got there he brushed his teeth and combed his hair.<s>
He went to the kitchen, where he poured some milk into his favorite green bowl and added some cereal.<s>
After he finished eating, he went back up to his bedroom to choose his clothes for the day.<s>
He put on a red T-shirt and blue jeans, and some funny blue-and-yellow socks.<s>
He looked in the mirror and smiled.<s>
It was going to be a good day.<s>
Marvin thought he would go for a walk.<s>
He opened his door and went outside.<s>
The sun was shining and he could hear the bluebirds in the trees.<s>
Marvin started to whistle a happy song as he made his way down the street.<s>
He counted the cars that passed by.<s>
Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her.<s>
She waved back, and came over.<s>
"Hi Marvin," she said.<s>
"Do you want to go to the lake today?"<s>
Marvin smiled.<s>
"Yeah!"<s>
he said, "let me go home and get my things."<s>
So Marvin turned right around and went back home.<s>
