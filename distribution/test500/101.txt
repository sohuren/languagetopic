Leah and the Big Yellow Dog  Leah was very happy.<s>
It was a bright, sunny day and Mommy was taking her to Leah's favorite place.<s>
Leah loved the play park near the water!<s>
Mommy parked the car and Leah ran out right away and climbed the big slide.<s>
Up she went and then down.<s>
Two other kids saw Leah and ran over and slid down, too.<s>
Leah was laughing and happy.<s>
Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park.<s>
This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with.<s>
But Leah was scared of dogs.<s>
Leah didn't see the dog at first.<s>
Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah.<s>
Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.<s>
The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.<s>
Leah was scared.<s>
She started yelling and screaming.<s>
This only made the dog look confused.<s>
The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself.<s>
They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling.<s>
Mommy went over and took Leah away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing.<s>
The dog's master came and got the dog, and Leah went back to playing.<s>
"Some dogs are nice," Mommy told Leah.<s>
