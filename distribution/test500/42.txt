One day Rachel was walking in the park.<s>
Suddenly a kitten came up to her and meowed.<s>
It reached up and put its feet on Rachel's leg.<s>
It was so friendly!<s>
But the kitten was very skinny.<s>
Its ribs were showing and the sides of its belly were almost touching.<s>
It had no collar.<s>
Rachel thought that the kitten must not have a home.<s>
She brought the kitten home with her.<s>
She looked on the Internet to see if it matched a lost kitten ad.<s>
But none of the missing kittens looked like her kitten.<s>
Rachel took the kitten to the doctor to see if there was an ID chip under the skin.<s>
The doctor looked at the kitten with a machine but there was no chip.<s>
So Rachel knew this really was a kitten without a home.<s>
She knew she would have enough money to pay for the kitten's food and care.<s>
She knew she could make enough time to play with the kitten too keep it happy.<s>
She paid the doctor to give the kitten its shots.<s>
She brought it back home and gave it food and toys.<s>
Rachel and the kitten lived happily together for years.<s>
