Dr. Curtis  On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis.<s>
Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday.<s>
He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.<s>
Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat.<s>
He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick.<s>
Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony.<s>
The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did.<s>
The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine.<s>
And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.<s>
When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home.<s>
But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside.<s>
Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.<s>
Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up.<s>
Later, his father came and woke him.<s>
"Bonnie is going to be alright," he said to Curtis.<s>
"Really?"<s>
the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her."<s>
"That can wait.<s>
Right now you need to eat something.<s>
I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.<s>
Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn.<s>
He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth.<s>
He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart.<s>
Then he checked her legs and tail.<s>
He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.<s>
Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy.<s>
I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses."<s>
"Okay, Dr. Curtis," his dad said as he patted Curtis on the back.<s>
"Let's take her outside."<s>
