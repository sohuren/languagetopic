A little boy named Justin lived on a farm.<s>
His father James owned the farm.<s>
His uncles Jerry, Todd, and Billy also worked on the farm.<s>
The farm had chickens, cows, horses, sheep, and pigs.<s>
He loved to play with all of the animals on the farm, but the horses were his favorite.<s>
He would spend all day riding the horses.<s>
He loved when baby horses were born.<s>
They were born in the spring.<s>
When a baby horse was born, Justin's father would bring the baby out of the barn for Justin to pet.<s>
Justin also loved playing in the fields on the farm.<s>
He would run through the meadows trying to catch butterflies.<s>
He also loved to stay up late and catch fireflies in the dark.<s>
Justin also loved going fishing in the summer.<s>
On one Tuesday evening, he went to the farm's pond and caught a huge catfish.<s>
The fish was so large that it almost broke his fishing pole.<s>
Justin brought the fish in.<s>
The fish looked at Justin with sad eyes.<s>
Looking at the fish, Justin felt bad that he had caught it.<s>
He threw the catfish back into the pond.<s>
He packed away his fishing pole and went back home.<s>
He told his father about the catfish and how he let it go.<s>
His father said, "I am proud of you for doing that, son."<s>
