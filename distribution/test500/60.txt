A man sailed out to sea in a small boat.<s>
The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing.<s>
A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat.<s>
He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook.<s>
He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time.<s>
After three hours there was still not a bite.<s>
The sun moved slowly across the sky.<s>
Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening.<s>
It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up.<s>
A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours.<s>
It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly.<s>
The fisherman went home empty handed.<s>
He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire.<s>
His stomach growled because there wasn't any dinner to eat tonight, but tomorrow would be a better day.<s>
