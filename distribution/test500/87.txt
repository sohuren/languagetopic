Rory the race car loves to race.<s>
She loves to take lots of laps around the track.<s>
Sometimes, she likes to race her friend Rudy the race truck.<s>
Most of the time, she wins.<s>
But one very special day, Rudy was feeling very fast.<s>
He filled up on gas that morning and was ready for action.<s>
He asked Rory to race him.<s>
They had to go around the track ten times.<s>
Rory could not wait.<s>
She thought she could beat him.<s>
They sat and the finish line and the light changed from red, to yellow, to green, and the race began!<s>
They drove around the track at lightning speed.<s>
Faster and faster Rory went.<s>
Rory seemed to be losing speed.<s>
One of her back tires was feeling strange.<s>
She slowed down and frowned.<s>
Rudy saw his friend had stopped.<s>
He turned around to see what was wrong.<s>
Rory told him her tire was about to fall off.<s>
He pulled her to the shop and they got the tire fixed.<s>
He didn't win the race, but he won a best friend.<s>
