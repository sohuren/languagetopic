One morning a girl named Ashely woke up before her Mom and Dad and started watching TV.<s>
Once her parents woke up, everybody got dressed to go food shopping for the week.<s>
Food shopping was one of Ashley's favorite things to do.<s>
The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart.<s>
The first foods they ran into were the fruits.<s>
Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons.<s>
As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread.<s>
After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food.<s>
Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different.<s>
The checkout lady, Sarah, was extra nice to her and as she was waiting for her parents to pay, Ashley's father picked out a candy for her to have.<s>
It was her favorite, chocolate!<s>
Ashley was so excited that she thanked her parents the whole ride home, and even said she would make breakfast.<s>
When the family got home that afternoon and the food was in the house, the whole family made their lunch of eggs and toast together.<s>
