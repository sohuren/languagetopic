John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea.<s>
He went all around the world, to see what he could see.<s>
In America, he went to a farm.<s>
There, he saw a barn.<s>
He had some milk from a cup.<s>
The cup was big; Cow filled it up!<s>
In Africa, he went to the wild.<s>
He saw a tiger and heard it growl.<s>
From the growl, he ran away.<s>
He wanted to live another day!<s>
In England he went riding on a horse.<s>
He had so much fun, up in the North!<s>
The horse grew tired; they stopped to rest.<s>
It was time to move on, it was for the best.<s>
In Italy, he wanted a sandwich.<s>
Problem was, he could not choose which!<s>
The tuna salad?<s>
The ham and cheese?<s>
It was too much, he had to leave.<s>
In Siberia, he spent a winter.<s>
The houses were frozen, he could not enter!<s>
Where did he sleep, what did he do?<s>
We do not know, not me, not you!<s>
John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea.<s>
He'd gone all around the world, but the sea was where he wanted to be.<s>
