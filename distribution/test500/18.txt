One day, a dad and his daughter, named Sarah, went on a trip to pick pears from a tree.<s>
Sarah was wearing a pretty pink shirt and her dad was wearing a green shirt.<s>
Sarah's dad gave her a hug as they walked to the pear tree.<s>
When they picked pears, Sarah's dad had to lift her on his back, because she could not reach the pears high in the tree.<s>
Sarah and her dad picked thirty four in five hours!<s>
Sarah was hungry, so her dad said she could eat one of the pears they picked.<s>
While she was eating, she didn't say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.<s>
She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.<s>
When they got home, Sarah's grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.<s>
As Sarah was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.<s>
