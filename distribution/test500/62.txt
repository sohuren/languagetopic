One day, Jimmy, who was getting ready to walk down to school, could not find his favorite hat.<s>
He began looking all over the place for it, his room, the kitchen, even outside.<s>
It was nowhere to be found.<s>
He was running late for school and didn't want to be marked absent so he went to school without it.<s>
At school, Jimmy kept becoming upset because he couldn't find his hat.<s>
When Jimmy got home his hat was sitting there next to his goldfish.<s>
His mom had found it.<s>
It was in the kitchen the whole time.<s>
