The big white bear walked over the ice.<s>
After he went a few feet, he pushed his paws down on the ice as hard as he could.<s>
The sheet of ice cracked, and the big bear learned that he still had to wait.<s>
The big white bear was waiting to go out to the ice and hunt.<s>
He was getting thin after a long summer in the far north, and he was ready to catch a seal.<s>
In a few weeks, he could walk out on the ice, far from shore.<s>
There, he could find seals or other animals that he could catch.<s>
He would come back from the cold winter a lot fatter.<s>
But for now, he would have to wait.<s>
In a few more days, the ice would be thick enough for him to go out and hunt.<s>
The cold winds were starting to make some of the ice very thick.<s>
But this spot was too thin, and he would have to wait.<s>
