It was warmer than normal outside at the zoo.<s>
The clown was hot in his costume.<s>
He still smiled and he still made people laugh.<s>
He worked hard.<s>
He threw a plane because someone's son asked him to.<s>
He even put jelly on his face because a little girl said it would make him look pretty.<s>
At noon he juggled plates and at one in the afternoon he sat down to have some lunch.<s>
The cook made a salad to his liking and the clown ate it happily.<s>
He felt famous because people visiting the zoo pointed at him and smiled at him as he ate his salad.<s>
The day might be hot, but the clown felt it was good in the end because of how much people liked him.<s>
Soon he was back to work juggling and telling jokes.<s>
He even sprayed someone with water when they smelled his fake flower.<s>
