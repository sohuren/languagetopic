When it is the end of school and the weather is warmer, that is a beautiful time called summer.<s>
Summer is wonderful because there are so many amazing things to do!<s>
You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television.<s>
You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast!<s>
I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation!<s>
When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday.<s>
My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together.<s>
That's a stinker when that happens.<s>
It's a good thing that I have a pig named Joseph to be my friend during those times!<s>
I also have other friends, like a cat and a dog, but Joseph is the best.<s>
He's a stinker sometimes, but he's got cute little oinks to help me to know what he needs.<s>
He's also very sweet, caring, and he's always ready to listen.<s>
He's a wonderful friend.<s>
