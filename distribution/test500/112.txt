The kid was going for a quick swim.<s>
He loved to get out and hop back into the water.<s>
When he was out of the pool he liked to dance and run around.<s>
Sometimes when he got out he would sit in the chair and get some sun.<s>
He liked to work on his skin color.<s>
Just like his mommy.<s>
He would take his toys and hop in the water with them.<s>
He liked to play football in the water the most.<s>
He was taller than the other kids his age, so he could play football and not worry about the bigger kids.<s>
He could jump into the deeper section of the pool as long as he got back to where he could touch before his mom worried too much.<s>
The pool was his favorite place in the world.<s>
The boy could imagine he was doing anything.<s>
All of his problems went away.<s>
It was a very nice place for him to get his energy out and make friends for when he wasn't at the pool.<s>
He loved making friends.<s>
