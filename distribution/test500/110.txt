There once was a boy named John who was a good superhero.<s>
He thought he was a superhero, at least.<s>
His mommy made him eat his cereal with yoghurt every morning so he could stay strong.<s>
Today he had to go to school and he wasn't very happy about that.<s>
After breakfast he walked to the bus stop.<s>
There he found his neighbor Ashley, who was also an evil superhero.<s>
John thought she was an evil superhero at least.<s>
When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him.<s>
Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk.<s>
John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare.<s>
He picked up the worm.<s>
It was slimy and gross.<s>
It wiggled around between his fingers.<s>
John closed his eyes and licked it.<s>
Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground.<s>
But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere.<s>
First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school.<s>
He hoped his mommy would let him wear it.<s>
The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing.<s>
John had a great, superhero kind of thought.<s>
He put the worm in her hair.<s>
Now Ashley was screaming!<s>
John the superhero got in trouble for that.<s>
