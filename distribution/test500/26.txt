Tomorrow was Little Bunny's birthday.<s>
He was very excited.<s>
He wanted to invite all of his friends.<s>
"We only have enough cake for five friends."<s>
His mother said.<s>
Little Bunny thought and thought.<s>
He wanted to invite Rabbit, Bear, Duck and Goose.<s>
Little Bunny could invite one more friend.<s>
He thought about Turtle.<s>
Turtle was lots of fun and always told funny jokes.<s>
He thought about Fox.<s>
Fox was super nice and always made Little Bunny feel good.<s>
He also thought about how not inviting one of his friends would make them feel bad.<s>
Little Bunny didn't want to make anyone feel bad.<s>
After a little bit he had an idea.<s>
He told his mother his idea.<s>
"I like both Turtle and Fox, and I want them both to come.<s>
One would feel really left out if they didn't get invited.<s>
I can give my cake to one of my friends, and that way they can both come and have a piece."<s>
His mother thought it was very sweet of Little Bunny to give up his piece of birthday cake so that none of his friends would feel left out.<s>
"I'll tell you what."<s>
Said his mother.<s>
"I'll make a batch of cupcakes, and all of your friends can have some."<s>
