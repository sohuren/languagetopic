Allie was trying to choose which costume she would wear for Halloween.<s>
She did not want to dress up as a scary monster.<s>
She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.<s>
She thought that wings would be too hard to make.<s>
Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.<s>
Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.<s>
Allie looked in the refrigerator but there were no carrots.<s>
She took some spinach instead.<s>
Allie got an old pillow case out of the hall closet.<s>
She would use it to carry the candy she would get.<s>
Allie's little sister, Grace, was going as a princess dressed in pink.<s>
She had a shiny, silver purse on her arm.<s>
Allie took Grace by the hand and led her down the sidewalk.<s>
The first door they knocked on was answered by a woman dressed as witch with a tall, black hat on her head.<s>
The witch gave both of the girls some candied apples.<s>
