Jake liked his old sneakers but they were getting too small.<s>
He tried on sixteen different pairs of shoes at the mall with his mom.<s>
He was looking for green shoes with blue laces.<s>
He couldn't find any he liked and left sad.<s>
His mom wanted to cheer him up.<s>
They stopped for lunch at a restaurant drive-thru.<s>
"What do you want to order?"<s>
asked Jake's Mom as she got a cheeseburger and a large drink.<s>
He ordered a hamburger.<s>
While they ate, Jake and his mom talked about different shoes Jake might try on next.<s>
He didn't want to go back to the store, but he really wanted green shoes.<s>
He ate some of her fries as he thought about it.<s>
Suddenly, his mom had a great idea.<s>
They would paint a pair of new shoes green!<s>
Jake loved that idea.<s>
So they went to the Art Store and bought green paint.<s>
They went back to the mall and bought new blue shoelaces and white sneakers.<s>
Jake was so excited about his shoes that he painted them as soon as he got home.<s>
Afterwards, he walked around the house in his new shoes dripping green paint.<s>
