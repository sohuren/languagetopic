Sally was walking through the park.<s>
The bluebirds were singing and the weather was nice.<s>
She waved at her neighbor Jerry, who was taking his kitten out.<s>
Then she heard a loud noise.<s>
The noise was coming from a nearby tree.<s>
She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots.<s>
It was making a loud, sad noise.<s>
Sally bent down and picked up the puppy.<s>
It quickly quieted down, and licked her face.<s>
Sally laughed.<s>
The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw.<s>
She couldn't find a tag on him, so she took him home.<s>
When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge.<s>
The puppy seemed to like it.<s>
She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up.<s>
Then the puppy yawned.<s>
Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow.<s>
Sally looked at him with a smile.<s>
"I'm going to call you...Jackson."<s>
Jackson wagged his tail a little, and fell asleep.<s>
