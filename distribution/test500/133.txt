Bill dug a small hole and placed the seed inside.<s>
Then, he covered up the hole with dirt, and poured some water on it.<s>
It was such a small seed, and it was hard to believe that it would turn into a giant pumpkin.<s>
Every day, Bill went out to the garden to check on the seed.<s>
Some days, if the ground was dry, he poured more water on it.<s>
After a few days, a tiny green plant started coming out of the ground.<s>
Bill kept checking every day, and the plant kept getting bigger and bigger.<s>
Soon, there were tiny leaves on the plant.<s>
As the summer went on, the whole plant kept getting bigger and bigger.<s>
Soon, he could see tiny fruits starting to grow.<s>
They kept getting bigger and bigger.<s>
Eventually, he could tell that they were pumpkins!<s>
That fall, the pumpkins were really big.<s>
Bill picked the biggest one and brought it to the fair.<s>
He got a blue ribbon for the biggest pumpkin!<s>
Bill's parents had other plants in their garden.<s>
They had strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and many other fruits and vegetables.<s>
But they all started as tiny seeds.<s>
