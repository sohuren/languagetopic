Steve was excited about the trip he was taking tonight.<s>
The family was going out to his favorite place to eat.<s>
Steve loved spaghetti and meatballs, and the restaurant made the very best!<s>
When Steve and his parents got to the restaurant, his mother had to tell him to stop running so fast.<s>
Steve couldn't help himself, he wanted to be inside and at a table so badly.<s>
The restaurant had pictures of all the people that used to work there in the past, it had been around for a long time with a history of such great food.<s>
It was not the first time his mother had to tell him to slow down.<s>
When they were taken to their table and went through the curtain to the dining area, Steve had another nice surprise waiting for him.<s>
It would not be a table for three, his favorite aunt and uncle were waiting at the table for them!<s>
Steve sat down quickly to get some of the bread sticks before they were all gone.<s>
Steve did not even need a menu, he knew what he wanted.<s>
Bring on the spaghetti and meatballs, nice and hot!<s>
