Jamie was on the playground.<s>
As he was running towards his friends, he tripped on a classmate's toy truck and fell.<s>
He skinned his knee.<s>
He got up and saw that the watch that his brother had given him had broken when he fell.<s>
Jamie was very sad about his watch breaking, which was the second bad thing to happen to him today.<s>
One of his friends saw that he had fallen.<s>
Lindsay heard Jamie saying that his watch was broken.<s>
He was mad at the boy, Kevin, who had left his truck on the playground for Jamie to fall over.<s>
Lindsay tried to tell him that it was not his Kevin's fault that Jamie had fallen.<s>
She said, "Let's take your watch to the teacher.<s>
I think Miss Henderson can fix it."<s>
Miss Henderson fixed Jamie's watch, and told him to be more careful when he was running outside.<s>
After his watch was fixed and he felt better, Lindsay clapped.<s>
"I told you it would be okay," she said.<s>
She and Jamie went out to play with their other friends.<s>
