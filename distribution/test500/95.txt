Once upon a time there was a little elf named Boo.<s>
Boo longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one.<s>
Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself.<s>
With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish.<s>
First he looked under his pillow.<s>
No goldfish there.<s>
Then he looked in the fridge.<s>
No goldfish their either.<s>
Frustrated, he went to his friend Miles.<s>
Miles was an alligator.<s>
Boo asked Miles, "Miles, where could I find a goldfish?"<s>
Miles thought long and hard.<s>
Then he thought some more.<s>
He thought even more after that.<s>
At long last, Miles spoke.<s>
"I have an idea," he said, "but you must do a few things for me first.<s>
First you must clap for me."<s>
Boo clapped many times.<s>
"Now," spoke Miles, "You must chirp like a young bird."<s>
Boo chirped happily.<s>
"Last," said Miles, "You must fold my laundry.<s>
It is behind the wood pile."<s>
Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry.<s>
When he was all done he returned to Miles.<s>
"Miles," he asked, "Where can I find a goldfish?"<s>
Miles smiled as he spoke, "Fish swim, yes?<s>
Look in a place with water."<s>
Boo quickly returned home and began his hunt.<s>
First he looked in his drink cup.<s>
No goldfish there.<s>
Then he looked in the toilet.<s>
What he saw in the toilet surprised him.<s>
There was a goldfish swimming in the toilet!<s>
As it turned out, it was a very special goldfish.<s>
The fish was a funny color.<s>
It wasn't red.<s>
It wasn't orange.<s>
It wasn't green.<s>
It was blue!<s>
Boo named his goldfish Apple Cracker and they quickly became friends.<s>
