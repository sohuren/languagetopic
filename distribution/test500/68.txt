She began to cough.<s>
Mrs. Harper told her to go get some water to drink and a boy named Henry finished the story.<s>

Someone asked if butterflies ate other bugs.<s>
Mrs. Harper said that butterflies don't eat but only drink.<s>
Josie was chosen to pass out turkey sandwiches for lunch.<s>
Mrs. Harper went to the refrigerator.<s>
She got out some vanilla yoghurt for each of the boys and girls.<s>
All the students cheered.<s>
