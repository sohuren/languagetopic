A little mouse lived in a little house.<s>
The mouse would hurry along the walls at night looking for food.<s>
Sometimes he'd find frosting from a cake.<s>
Those were good days.<s>
Sometimes he'd find paint from a paint can.<s>
Those were bad days.<s>
Either way, he'd always get scared whenever the phone rang.<s>
It was so loud and made him jump.<s>
Yesterday he tripped over a wire because he wasn't looking where he was going.<s>
The television was on full volume so no one saw it.<s>
He loved running around in the kitchen.<s>
There was always leftover food on a spoon in the sink.<s>
Sometimes it was dried food and he'd have to scrape it off with his claws.<s>
It still tasted good to the mouse.<s>
He was so happy there were no other animals living around there.<s>
He had heard a piggy ate a lot more than a mouse.<s>
He didn't want to have to fight a piggy over food.<s>
Life was really good for this little mouse.<s>
