One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly.<s>
He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock.<s>
He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him.<s>
He looked around the rock, but couldn't see anything.<s>
Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy.<s>
"I wonder what's making that noise," Billy said.<s>
Beverly ate some grass.<s>
He went back home.<s>
Beverly followed him.<s>
Billy asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock.<s>
She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel.<s>
"Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said.<s>
"Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you."<s>
"That's a good idea," Billy said.<s>
He dug under the rock with the spoon.<s>
Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.<s>
Then Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead.<s>
At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole.<s>
Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill.<s>
"Thank you, Beverly," Billy said.<s>
"I couldn't have done it without you."<s>
Billy and Beverly looked where the rock had been.<s>
In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it.<s>
The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food.<s>
Billy went back home and told Judy, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.<s>
