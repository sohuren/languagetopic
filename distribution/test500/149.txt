Joey went to a baseball game during the winter this year.<s>
He went by himself knowing he would enjoy the game much more than if he had gone with his friends Sam, Mark and David.<s>
His friends like to talk and hang out more than watch the game itself.<s>
The game was very exciting; Joey sat at the edge of his chair the whole game.<s>
The game ended with his home team winning by one run.<s>
The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away.<s>
On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner.<s>
When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing.<s>
After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert.<s>
His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake.<s>
He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that.<s>
On his way home he thought someone was tailing him so he turned off into a coffee store.<s>
When they drove by he went home.<s>
