Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump.<s>
There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock.<s>
Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer.<s>
When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at.<s>
Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock.<s>
Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump.<s>
There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat.<s>
A deer even came through once.<s>
Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back.<s>
The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch.<s>
She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close.<s>
But that didn't stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them.<s>
Jane liked being active.<s>
Even when Jane was all alone, she was active.<s>
Jane was a happy dog.<s>
