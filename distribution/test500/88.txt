There once was a spider name Thomas.<s>
Thomas lived in North Carolina.<s>
Thomas was traveling to see his grandmother.<s>
His grandmother did not live in North Carolina.<s>
She lived in Georgia.<s>
Georgia was far from Thomas's house, so he had to take a train.<s>
He bought a ticket for the train ride.<s>
The ticket was five dollars.<s>
Before he got on the train, Thomas the spider packed his bag.<s>
He packed his blanket, two shirts, and two pairs of pants.<s>
He did not pack any books or toys.<s>
His grandmother had toys for him to play with.<s>
She also had books for him to read.<s>
Thomas likes to read and play with toys.<s>
Thomas used the phone to call his grandmother to tell her he was coming to visit.<s>
She was very excited.<s>
Thomas took his bag and went to the train.<s>
At the train Thomas looked at the snacks.<s>
He wanted vanilla pudding.<s>
They did not have vanilla or chocolate, so Thomas got strawberry.<s>
He took his bag and strawberry pudding and got on the train.<s>
