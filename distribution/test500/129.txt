In the winter Steve would get too cold and would stay in his house.<s>
Steve loved the zookeeper's helper Bob.<s>
The zookeeper's name was Joe, but he never came in to see Steve.<s>
Bob would feed Steve treats all summer long when he was working.<s>
In the spring, Tim was the zookeeper's helper and would never feed Steve treats, so Steve didn't like him.<s>
Steve loved that Bob would give him was fish more than anything.<s>
Steve also liked bananas, oranges and apples, but fish was his favorite.<s>

Sometimes he would wave his arm to some visitors if they seemed to be nice.<s>
Steve loved the summer; it was his favorite time of the year.<s>
He got treats and his favorite helper Bob worked during the summer.<s>
