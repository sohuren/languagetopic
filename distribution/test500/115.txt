Justin sat down for dinner with his Mother, who was 40, and Father, who was 45 and Sister as he always did when it was time to eat.<s>
He always sat across from his sister, Melissa.<s>
Tonight's dinner was meatloaf, mashed potatoes with butter, and green peas.<s>
Justin's mother made the best meatloaf.<s>
She said that her mother used the same recipe.<s>
Similar recipes were made by her friend, her aunt, and sister.<s>
But the one Justin's mom used was the best.<s>
Melissa was 7 years old, and Justin was 10.<s>
Melissa waited until she didn't think Mom and dad were looking and stuck her tongue out at Justin.<s>
What Melissa didn't know was that her mom had seen her and told her that it wasn't polite.<s>
"But mom!<s>
I was only playing!"<s>
Melissa said.<s>
"No 'buts', young lady!"<s>
Mom said.<s>
Justin shook his head as he took a bite of mashed potatoes.<s>
