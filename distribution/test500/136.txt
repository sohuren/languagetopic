Jane went with her family swimming to the pool.<s>
Jane and her brother, Mark, get along really well and they always have so much fun at the pool together.<s>
This time, there was a huge storm coming.<s>
As they were swimming, the life guard told everyone to get out of the pool.<s>
The life guard also warned everyone of the storm.<s>
Jane and Mark got out of the pool as fast as they could and went to a safe place and waited until the storm was over.<s>
Jane started to get worried as the storm got worse and worse.<s>
Mark told her not to worry because he didn't think the storm was very bad and that he thought it was almost over.<s>
As he told her about the storm, a man walked by and told them that the storm was almost over and that they could go back and swim in a little bit.<s>
Jane was very happy to hear that she can go back to having fun in the pool with her brother.<s>
When the storm was over, Mark and Jane walked to the store to get some candy before they raced to the pool and jumped in.<s>
