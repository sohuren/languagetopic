Lisa wants a new pet.<s>
Sometimes it is very hard trying to choose a new pet.<s>
There are so many different animals, each cuter than the last.<s>
There are cats, dogs, and goldfishes.<s>
In the end, Lisa chose a bunny.<s>
Lisa's bunny is very cute.<s>
The bunny has snowy white fur and large black eyes.<s>
His ears are large, floppy, and grey.<s>
She named the bunny Chomper since Chomper loves to eat everything.<s>
Chomper eats carrots, celery, and even licks Lisa's fingers!<s>
Nothing to worry, Chompers has a very small mouth and he is never fussy.<s>
Except...every time Lisa leans down to kiss Chomper - he runs away!<s>
Why?<s>
Chomper thinks Lisa is trying to steal his treats!<s>
He hates sharing his treats.<s>
Chomper always wants second helpings of food.<s>
Lisa is afraid Chomper would get so big he could fall off her lap.<s>
But not to worry Lisa, Chomper hops around the house a lot.<s>
Chomper knows how to stay fit like Lisa.<s>
It's clear as day!<s>
Lisa and Chomper make great friends.<s>
