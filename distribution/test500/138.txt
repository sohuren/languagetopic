Susie woke up early on Saturday morning.<s>
She was very happy because her cousin, Mary, was coming to visit today.<s>
She was also happy about the new kittens.<s>
They were only a few weeks old, and so cute!<s>
Susie ran into the kitchen.<s>
Her mother was cooking breakfast.<s>
"I can't wait to show Mary the new kittens," Susie announced to her mother.<s>
"Do you think her mother is going to allow her to have one?"<s>
"I don't know," Susie's mom answered.<s>
"I hope so.<s>
Six kittens - that's too many!<s>
I only want to keep two kittens.<s>
She is going to be here soon."<s>
Susie hurried through breakfast and ran outside to wait on Mary.<s>
She jumped up and down with excitement when she saw a car turn into the driveway.<s>
Susie ran toward the car as Mary opened the door.<s>
"We have new kittens," Susie announced with a smile.<s>
"Mom says you can take one home."<s>
"Can I Mommy, please," Mary asked her mother.<s>
"I need to think about it," said Mary's mother.<s>
"Come on!"<s>
Susie said and ran toward the barn where the kittens were.<s>
Mary ran after her.<s>
Mary and Susie played with the kittens all day.<s>
