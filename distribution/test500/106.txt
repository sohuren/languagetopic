I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group.<s>
The weekend long camp included a lot of different games.<s>
One of the games was for fire-building.<s>
The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires.<s>
There are many different ways you can build a campfire.<s>
You can build a lean-to campfire.<s>
You can also build a teepee fire.<s>
To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going.<s>
The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground.<s>
My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string.<s>
We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.<s>
