Once upon a time, there lived a Daddy bird.<s>
This was a very normal bird.<s>
It did not sing pretty songs.<s>
It did not have colorful feathers but it did have thing that made it stand out from the other birds.<s>
It had a very long tail feather.<s>
And with this long tail feather, the bird could do wonderful tricks.<s>
He could fly in circles and fly at super-fast speed.<s>
Daddy bird lived on a quiet street, at a yellow house.<s>
Its nest was on top of a basketball pole that the kids who lived in the yellow house had outgrown.<s>
The bird was a daddy bird and had two baby birds in its nest.<s>
One of the baby birds had a long tail feather like the daddy bird.<s>
The other baby bird did not.<s>
Instead, it had wings with many colors like the mommy bird.<s>
This bird family lived at the yellow house all summer long.<s>
The mommy and daddy birds came back for many summers and had many more baby birds but only one, the very first baby bird, had a long tail feather and could do tricks like daddy bird.<s>
