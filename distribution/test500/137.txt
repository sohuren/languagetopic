June and Michelle were playing outside in their yard on a winter day.<s>
Michelle was making pies and cakes out of mud.<s>
June was writing her ABCs in the sand with a button she found.<s>
June's mom told the girls they were going to the store soon and not to get dirty.<s>
Michelle knew she would get in trouble but she kept playing in the dirt because she liked pretending to cook.<s>
Her mom cooked and Michelle wanted to be grown-up like her mom.<s>
June looked down at her blue jeans and saw the dirt.<s>
"Oh No!"<s>
she said to Michelle.<s>
Michelle looked down at the mud on her shoes and shirt.<s>
She smiled, "Mommy says cooking is messy business!"<s>
"What are we going to do?<s>
Mom is going to be so mad!"<s>
June worried.<s>
"We can tell her we were thinking as we played, she always says school is not only a place."<s>
Michelle said.<s>
"That won't work!"<s>
June cried.<s>
"Wait!<s>
I have an idea."<s>
Michelle said as she wiped her hands on the back of her blue jeans.<s>
Michelle walked over to June's fence and pulled out the prettiest prized purple flowers from the bush.<s>
June looked at her friend more worried.<s>
Michelle walked past June and knocked on the door with the purple flowers in her hand and a big smile on her face.<s>
Mrs. Jones answered the door looking mad.<s>
Before she could say anything Michelle said, "Look Mrs. Jones we picked you flowers and June did her ABCs."<s>
Mrs. Jones wanted to be mad at them but their smiles warmed her heart.<s>
"Thank you dear.<s>
Please go change clothes and rinse off for our trip to the store.<s>
The girls walked in the house leaving a trail of mud on the floor.<s>
