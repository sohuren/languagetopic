In a big forest lived a fox named Manny.<s>
He was having a fun morning.<s>
Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy!<s>
Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure.<s>
After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log.<s>
They looked at each other, but did not say anything.<s>
Manny spoke first.<s>
"Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox.<s>
Who are you?"<s>
The frog on the log didn't answer at first.<s>
He finally said, "My name is Tony and I'm a frog.<s>
My brother could beat you up."<s>
Manny was very surprised to hear this.<s>
First, why would a frog's brother want to fight him?<s>
Second, how could some little frog beat him up?<s>
Manny told Tony he didn't think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him.<s>
Tony jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, "You're a liar!<s>
My brother can beat up anyone!"<s>
As the frog went away, Manny was very confused.<s>
He didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the frog was sad because of what Manny said.<s>
Manny also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog.<s>
He soon found out that Tony's brother was not from the same mother.<s>
His brother was a brown bear named Greg.<s>
After taking a good look at Greg, Manny said yes, Greg could beat up anyone he chose.<s>
After that day all three of them became close friends.<s>
