The girl was scared.<s>
She had been lost in the woods for over an hour.<s>
Then she heard something howling in the distance.<s>
Finally, it was getting dark.<s>
It all made her more scared than she had ever been.<s>
The howling grew louder.<s>
Then the girl came into a small opening in the woods.<s>
And she saw the wolf!<s>
She was so scared she cried out, "Please don't eat me Mr. Wolf!"<s>
A grey wolf, with grey fur, black eyes, and white teeth looked at her.<s>
Then he let out a big, wolf laugh.<s>
"Haha, I am not going to eat you!<s>
I don't like to eat humans!<s>
They taste bad.<s>
Plus, I am full!<s>
Do you want some spaghetti?<s>
It's been cooking for days!<s>
I was going to make some salad but I am out.<s>
I'll go to the grocery store tomorrow, I haven't been there in months!"<s>
The girl was confused.<s>
A wolf who ate salad?<s>
But she was hungry.<s>
So she sat down and ate with the wolf.<s>
He was so pleased she ate with him he gave her a map.<s>
Then he showed her how to get out of the woods.<s>
Her mother would never believe her.<s>
