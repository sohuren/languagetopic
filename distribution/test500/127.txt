Grace was very excited about Halloween.<s>
She wanted to dress up as a beautiful princess.<s>
Her brother Max wanted to be a zebra.<s>
Their mother made their costumes and got them ready to go trick-or-treating.<s>
The three of them walked through their neighborhood and saw all of the other children in their costumes.<s>
They saw their friends Mary and her sister Melissa.<s>
Mary was dressed as a princess, like Grace.<s>
The two girls said hello and looked over each other's costumes.<s>
Grace had a purple dress with a pink hat; Mary had a pink dress with a purple hat.<s>
The two girls switched hats so their hats matched their costumes.<s>
They said goodbye and went on trick-or-treating.<s>
Max and Grace walked up to the first house on their block and rang the doorbell.<s>
A large man dressed as a doggy opened the door and gave them a bunch of candy.<s>
They thanked him and moved on.<s>
The next house had a mummy standing on the front porch.<s>
They knew it was a costume, but they were too afraid to go up to him and ask for candy, so they moved on to the next house.<s>
After they had walked the whole neighborhood and filled their bags with candy, Grace and Max went home with their mother.<s>
They dumped the candy out on the dining room table and began to eat it.<s>
"You had a nice Halloween, didn't you?"<s>
their mother asked them.<s>
Max and Grace smiled and said yes, they had.<s>
