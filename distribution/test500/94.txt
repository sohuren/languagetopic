The kitchen comes alive at night in the Sanderson house.<s>
Vegetables, fruit, bread, and more come out to play.<s>
The knives and forks dance on the tables.<s>
There are games and prizes.<s>
Milk is used for swimming races.<s>
The cereal often wins those.<s>
Fruit gets used as balls in some games.<s>
Blueberries scream in joy as they are kicked into soccer goals in games between the spoons and vegetables like celery and carrots.<s>
Their cousins, the raspberries, like to watch the games.<s>
Everyone has a great time and laughs.<s>
They are happy to come out and be friends.<s>
If someone, like little John or his sister Kim, comes down to get water, they all hide until they leave.<s>
The father, Ryan, sometimes wakes up and thinks he hears something downstairs.<s>
His wife, Susan, tells him he needs to go back to bed.<s>
She tells him he is imagining things.<s>
He is not.<s>
The kitchen got too loud.<s>
They were having so much fun they woke up the family!<s>
