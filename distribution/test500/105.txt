Once upon a time there was a small boy named Jeremy.<s>
Jeremy was very shy and did not have a lot of friends.<s>
One day, when he was sitting outside his house, he saw a small cat hiding around his house.<s>
The cat was under his porch.<s>
This cat was yellow.<s>
Yellow was Jeremy's favorite color.<s>
Jeremy went under the porch and caught the yellow cat.<s>
Jeremy was very happy when he caught the cat.<s>
A new cat meant he had a new friend to play with.<s>
Jeremy and the cat played every day.<s>
Jeremy loved his cat and they ran happily around the neighborhood.<s>
They played in his friend's front yard, in the street, and even by the garbage can.<s>
Jeremy loved his cat and the yellow cat loved Jeremy.<s>
The cat lived with Jeremy, along with his orange and black cat.<s>
Jeremy had lots of cats and he wants to get a blue cat.<s>
Jeremy's cats were his best friends and he was their favorite person.<s>
