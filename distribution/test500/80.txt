Joe was moving to a different state.<s>
He wanted to make the move without spending much money.<s>
He thought about driving in his own vehicle, but didn't do that.<s>
So Joe found a shipping company that shipped boxes on trailer trucks.<s>
First, Joe packed all his stuff in boxes.<s>
Then, he borrowed a small truck from a friend.<s>
He brought his belongings to the company's location with the small truck.<s>
At the company's building, he packed his stuff into a trailer.<s>
After all his belongings were in the trailer, he sealed off the trailer with a wooden wall.<s>
The company filled the rest of the trailer with their own stuff.<s>
Then they drove it to the same town where Joe was moving.<s>
After Joe flew to his new town, he borrowed another small truck.<s>
He drove to the company's location in his new town.<s>
There he took his stuff out of the trailer.<s>
He carried it to his new house in the small truck.<s>
It was more work than using a normal moving company, but Joe saved a lot of money.<s>
