Joe and his friends wanted to join the school's Christmas show. He asked his friends at school what would be a good idea for the Christmas show. They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use. One person wanted to do a dance show. Another person wanted to put on a play. So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone's idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, "musical". So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical. The first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job. Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show. Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights. Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes. Later, Joe wanted more singers so he added Sam and Marsha as singers. On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended. Joe and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream. The ice cream shop was all out of Joe's favorite flavor, strawberry, so Joe chose to get chocolate ice cream instead.
