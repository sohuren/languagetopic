Jake liked his old sneakers but they were getting too small. He tried on sixteen different pairs of shoes at the mall with his mom. He was looking for green shoes with blue laces. He couldn't find any he liked and left sad. His mom wanted to cheer him up. They stopped for lunch at a restaurant drive-thru. "What do you want to order?" asked Jake's Mom as she got a cheeseburger and a large drink. He ordered a hamburger. While they ate, Jake and his mom talked about different shoes Jake might try on next. He didn't want to go back to the store, but he really wanted green shoes. He ate some of her fries as he thought about it. Suddenly, his mom had a great idea. They would paint a pair of new shoes green! Jake loved that idea. So they went to the Art Store and bought green paint. They went back to the mall and bought new blue shoelaces and white sneakers. Jake was so excited about his shoes that he painted them as soon as he got home. Afterwards, he walked around the house in his new shoes dripping green paint.
