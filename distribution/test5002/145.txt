"If he cries we hold him until he is quiet," said Anna's dad. "What if he makes a mess in his diaper?" asked Anna. "Diapers smell but we clean them up," said Anna's mom. Anna thought about having a baby brother. Her mom and dad would take care of him. They bought a high chair for him to eat in. They brought out her old crib for him to sleep in.
