Anne was a young girl who lived with her grandma. She went to school every day with her favorite red ribbons in her hair. They were red with black stripes. Although Anne loved to wear her ribbons in her hair she saw that not many of the other students would wear ribbons in their hair, making her feel very out of place. So on a cold day Anne took the ribbons out of her hair and put her favorite headband on. Millisa was Ann's best friend; they shared everything with each other and trusted each other very much. Millisa asked Ann,"Dear friend, why are you wearing a headband today"? Anne with a sad face said, " I don't want to look different from everybody else." Millisa being the best friend Anne had ever had hugged her dear friend and whispered in her ear, "It's OK to be different and not like everybody else. Why some of us are short, some of us are tall, some of us have dark hair, and some of us have light hair. There is often some of us who even have red ribbons with stripes on them. Everybody is their own person, never be afraid to be who you are." Anne hugged her friend and placed her red ribbons back in her hair.
