Steve was excited about the trip he was taking tonight. The family was going out to his favorite place to eat. Steve loved spaghetti and meatballs, and the restaurant made the very best! When Steve and his parents got to the restaurant, his mother had to tell him to stop running so fast. Steve couldn't help himself, he wanted to be inside and at a table so badly. The restaurant had pictures of all the people that used to work there in the past, it had been around for a long time with a history of such great food. It was not the first time his mother had to tell him to slow down. When they were taken to their table and went through the curtain to the dining area, Steve had another nice surprise waiting for him. It would not be a table for three, his favorite aunt and uncle were waiting at the table for them! Steve sat down quickly to get some of the bread sticks before they were all gone. Steve did not even need a menu, he knew what he wanted. Bring on the spaghetti and meatballs, nice and hot!
