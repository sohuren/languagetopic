The sound of the women washing laundry down at the lake woke Lizzie up. She yawned, stretching out like a lazy cat. Her sister was also awake. "Lizzie", Meghan whispered, "are you awake?" Lizzie nodded and rolled out of bed. Meghan rolled over and went back to sleep. As Lizzie walked down the hallway, she accidentally stepped on Ralph's tail. "Woof!" Ralph yelled, in pain. "Sorry, Ralph", said Lizzie. Lizzie went down the stairs and into the kitchen. She ate some milk and cereal for breakfast. Then she sat down to write a letter to her dad. As she was writing she heard Ralph playing with his ball. Lizzie's dad was a driver for a rich family in England. She had only met her dad in person once, but they wrote letters to each other every week. Her dad was a very busy man, and he did what he had to for his family. Sometimes Lizzie wished she could go to England, too. It wasn't fair that the other girls got to see their dads every day. After writing a page, Lizzie stopped. Her hand was covered in the black ink of the pen. She washed her hands and dried them. Then she went outside to wait for the postman. She would mail her letter right away.
