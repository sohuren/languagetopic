Leah rides her bike  Leah was excited. Today was her seventh birthday and she picking out her present. It was a new pink bike with a basket and bell. It was much prettier than her old red and white bike. The bell on her old bike didn't ring, and the basket on that bike was torn. The only problem was that Leah could not ride a bike yet. Her old bike had training wheels, but her new one did not. Leah wanted to ride her bike, but she was scared. Daddy told her, "Leah, everyone is scared at first, but once you try, you are going to learn and stop being scared." Leah watched her friends riding their bikes. First Owen rode by the house and back up the street. Then along rode Dulce and Ruby. Leah was sad. She wished she could go riding with them. Leah finally chose to learn to ride her bike. She put on a helmet, elbow pads and knee pads. She was ready for battle! Mommy and Daddy went out with Leah and watched her start to pedal down the street. After a small bit, the bike tipped over. She sat on the road looking sad. She looked so cute sitting there that Daddy wanted laugh, but instead said, "Leah, you can do it. Go again." Leah tried several more times, and soon was riding! She went down the street and back again. Here came her friends with their bikes. Leah shouted, "wait for me," and joined them riding down the street.
