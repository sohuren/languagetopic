It was warmer than normal outside at the zoo. The clown was hot in his costume. He still smiled and he still made people laugh. He worked hard. He threw a plane because someone's son asked him to. He even put jelly on his face because a little girl said it would make him look pretty. At noon he juggled plates and at one in the afternoon he sat down to have some lunch. The cook made a salad to his liking and the clown ate it happily. He felt famous because people visiting the zoo pointed at him and smiled at him as he ate his salad. The day might be hot, but the clown felt it was good in the end because of how much people liked him. Soon he was back to work juggling and telling jokes. He even sprayed someone with water when they smelled his fake flower.
