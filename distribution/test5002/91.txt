On Mother's Day Sunday I went to breakfast with my mom, sister and wife. The day before that, I bought my mom a lovely bunch of flowers. My mom had eggs, my sister had pancakes, and my wife had toast. I had a muffin. The restaurant was called Maggie's. It was not my favorite breakfast restaurant. I like Denny's or a diner. Breakfast was not good. The pancakes were soggy, the toast was burned and the eggs were cold. Even worse, my breakfast made me sick. But after breakfast we went back to my house and I gave my mom the present I bought. It was a sunny day, and we all had a nice afternoon.
