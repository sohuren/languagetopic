One day Kyle's Dad had to go for a long ride. He went on this ride because he wanted to get breakfast. With breakfast the dad always loved to get a banana in a drink. This was his favorite drink. But along the ride, Kyle's dad had a scare. The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book. Later he found his book in a white bin. Along with the book, there was a white costume. He thought that maybe this was a sign. So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume. He remembered that his son Kyle's favorite thing to do was play doctor. This made him remember that he never even asked his son Kyle if he wanted to come for the ride. So the dad turned around and drove all the way home to get his son. He asked Kyle if he wanted to come out to breakfast. Kyle got very excited and said he did. Kyle's dad was happy he came back because it helped him make his son happy.
