John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea. He went all around the world, to see what he could see. In America, he went to a farm. There, he saw a barn. He had some milk from a cup. The cup was big; Cow filled it up! In Africa, he went to the wild. He saw a tiger and heard it growl. From the growl, he ran away. He wanted to live another day! In England he went riding on a horse. He had so much fun, up in the North! The horse grew tired; they stopped to rest. It was time to move on, it was for the best. In Italy, he wanted a sandwich. Problem was, he could not choose which! The tuna salad? The ham and cheese? It was too much, he had to leave. In Siberia, he spent a winter. The houses were frozen, he could not enter! Where did he sleep, what did he do? We do not know, not me, not you! John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea. He'd gone all around the world, but the sea was where he wanted to be.
