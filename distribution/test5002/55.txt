There were many people at the store that day. This was because it was Saturday. It was even more full of people around noon when Mary and her mother went out to go shopping. In the store, Mary wanted her mother to buy her candy but Mary's mother was in a hurry. She did not have time for that. That is because she wanted to get home before it started to rain. Mary crossed her arms when her mother said no. Mary was sad that her mother would not get her any candy. But at home, her mother had a surprise for her. She told Mary to close her eyes. She thought it might be a toy. When she opened them again, she saw that her mother had baked her something. Her mother opened the oven. Inside was a cake. She jumped up in excitement. She didn't need to think how she felt. She was very happy. She did not want the candy now. She immediately took a big slice. She wasn't sure it she would eat it now. Then she ate it before she could make up her mind! Her smile then left her mouth. She quickly she became sad. Her mother had told her it was bedtime.
