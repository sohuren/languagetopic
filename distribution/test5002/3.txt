Jamie was on the playground. As he was running towards his friends, he tripped on a classmate's toy truck and fell. He skinned his knee. He got up and saw that the watch that his brother had given him had broken when he fell. Jamie was very sad about his watch breaking, which was the second bad thing to happen to him today. One of his friends saw that he had fallen. Lindsay heard Jamie saying that his watch was broken. He was mad at the boy, Kevin, who had left his truck on the playground for Jamie to fall over. Lindsay tried to tell him that it was not his Kevin's fault that Jamie had fallen. She said, "Let's take your watch to the teacher. I think Miss Henderson can fix it." Miss Henderson fixed Jamie's watch, and told him to be more careful when he was running outside. After his watch was fixed and he felt better, Lindsay clapped. "I told you it would be okay," she said. She and Jamie went out to play with their other friends.
