Today Bob was hungry. He had some pancakes in his fridge but did not feel like eating pancakes today. He thought to himself, "I want to get some food from the store." So he went to the store and bought a sandwich. When he was at the store there was a picture of a brown cat on the wall. Under that picture was a box full of candy. Bob knew that he did not want to eat too much candy, but he wanted to get some candy anyway. He went to the box of candy and put some in his shopping bag so he could buy it. Bob went to the front and paid for all of his food. After buying his food, he went home and ate it. The sandwich was delicious and after he ate the sandwich he ate the candy too. Bob was very happy that he was full now and no longer hungry.
