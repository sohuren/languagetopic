Once upon a time there was a little elf named Boo. Boo longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one. Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish. First he looked under his pillow. No goldfish there. Then he looked in the fridge. No goldfish their either. Frustrated, he went to his friend Miles. Miles was an alligator. Boo asked Miles, "Miles, where could I find a goldfish?" Miles thought long and hard. Then he thought some more. He thought even more after that. At long last, Miles spoke. "I have an idea," he said, "but you must do a few things for me first. First you must clap for me." Boo clapped many times. "Now," spoke Miles, "You must chirp like a young bird." Boo chirped happily. "Last," said Miles, "You must fold my laundry. It is behind the wood pile." Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry. When he was all done he returned to Miles. "Miles," he asked, "Where can I find a goldfish?" Miles smiled as he spoke, "Fish swim, yes? Look in a place with water." Boo quickly returned home and began his hunt. First he looked in his drink cup. No goldfish there. Then he looked in the toilet. What he saw in the toilet surprised him. There was a goldfish swimming in the toilet! As it turned out, it was a very special goldfish. The fish was a funny color. It wasn't red. It wasn't orange. It wasn't green. It was blue! Boo named his goldfish Apple Cracker and they quickly became friends.
