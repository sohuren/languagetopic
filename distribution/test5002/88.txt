There once was a spider name Thomas. Thomas lived in North Carolina. Thomas was traveling to see his grandmother. His grandmother did not live in North Carolina. She lived in Georgia. Georgia was far from Thomas's house, so he had to take a train. He bought a ticket for the train ride. The ticket was five dollars. Before he got on the train, Thomas the spider packed his bag. He packed his blanket, two shirts, and two pairs of pants. He did not pack any books or toys. His grandmother had toys for him to play with. She also had books for him to read. Thomas likes to read and play with toys. Thomas used the phone to call his grandmother to tell her he was coming to visit. She was very excited. Thomas took his bag and went to the train. At the train Thomas looked at the snacks. He wanted vanilla pudding. They did not have vanilla or chocolate, so Thomas got strawberry. He took his bag and strawberry pudding and got on the train.
