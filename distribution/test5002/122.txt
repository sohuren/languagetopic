My name is Sandra. Let me tell you the story of the best meal I ever had. I was sitting on the school bench outside Springfield Elementary School, waiting to pick up my granddaughter. She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles. We all wore full black costumes every time we played. "What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time." A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking! She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda. We hadn't seen each other since New York. Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn't remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore! It turns out; Matilda was also there to pick someone up from school. "Well, Sandra, why don't you join me and my grandson for lunch? There is a lovely Thai place right down the road.' We went there with my granddaughter and her grandson, and had a delicious meal. Our grandchildren got married 15 years later.
