Bill dug a small hole and placed the seed inside. Then, he covered up the hole with dirt, and poured some water on it. It was such a small seed, and it was hard to believe that it would turn into a giant pumpkin. Every day, Bill went out to the garden to check on the seed. Some days, if the ground was dry, he poured more water on it. After a few days, a tiny green plant started coming out of the ground. Bill kept checking every day, and the plant kept getting bigger and bigger. Soon, there were tiny leaves on the plant. As the summer went on, the whole plant kept getting bigger and bigger. Soon, he could see tiny fruits starting to grow. They kept getting bigger and bigger. Eventually, he could tell that they were pumpkins! That fall, the pumpkins were really big. Bill picked the biggest one and brought it to the fair. He got a blue ribbon for the biggest pumpkin! Bill's parents had other plants in their garden. They had strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and many other fruits and vegetables. But they all started as tiny seeds.
