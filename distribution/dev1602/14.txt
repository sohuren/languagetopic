This is a story about a bear and a wolf. The bear met the wolf one day in the woods. The bear said to the wolf, would you like to go to the river with me? The wolf said yes, he would like to go to the river. When the bear and the wolf got to the river they found that a beaver had built a bridge to the other side of the river. The bear and the wolf crossed the bridge that was built by the beaver and found that they were now in a part of the woods they had never seen before. A little worried that they may get lost in this part of the woods they had never seen before the bear and the wolf turned around. They went back over the bridge and were happy to be back in a part of the woods they knew so well. The beaver thanked both the bear and the wolf for trying out his new bridge and then started to build yet another bridge close to the first bridge. He was a very busy beaver.
