Hannah and her friend Mary were bored. They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do. They petted the cat. They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook. They snuck into Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them. She said, "You girls need something to do. Let's take a walk to the park!" Hannah and Mary looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily. "The park sounds great!" said Hannah. "Let's go!" cried Mary. So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park. They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way. Mary spotted a squirrel. Hannah saw a yellow bird. Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr. Smith's house. When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack. Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks. When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a trash can. As they walked back home, Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out quite well.
