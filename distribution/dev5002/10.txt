Thunder can move a seesaw. This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw. One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "Where were you?" the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting. Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.
