Today is Tommy's birthday! Everyone is getting ready for his great birthday party. He's been waiting all week for this day. His friends start to arrive at his house. All he wants is a new bike and the time to open presents is getting closer. After cake and games, his father yells, "Time for presents". One after another, he sees they are all great presents, fire trucks, coloring books, toys, but there is no bike. Tommy starts to get upset when he sees that he opened all his presents and he still has no bike. But right then he sees his mother wheeling a bike through the kitchen into the living room where we are. He jumps in the air with all the excitement. He actually got it! He then runs outside and rides his new bike down the street.
