Sally the cat went outside to play. First she went on the trail to the river. Sally sat and watched the fish. She wanted to catch a fish. The fish swam away too fast. Next she went to the field. Sally laid down in the grass and took a nap. There's nothing like a cat nap on a warm day. When Sally woke up she saw a mouse. Sally ran after the mouse and tried to catch it. The mouse ran into a hole and got away. "That's okay" Sally said. "I'll get him next time." Sally went back to the trail and began to walk home. When she got back to the river she took a drink of water. "This water tastes good" said Sally. When she got back to her house, Sally went inside and ate a cat treat. She spent the rest of day playing with her favorite person. "This was a good day" said Sally.
