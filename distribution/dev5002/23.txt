The angel alligator was quite the sight! It loved to scream with all its might! It loved to roll in mud and sun. Then it would go for a run. But why did it run? Why did it scream? It had a fork in its butt! It sat in a trashcan. This was not a smart thing to do! But he did it, oh yes, oh me, oh you! The alligator had a beard. It was a great beard. But nobody ever talked about his beard. Why? Because they would only see the fork in its butt! But one day, the alligator made a friend. The friend needed a fork. How was he to eat his spaghetti without a fork? But...I'm not sure a butt fork is the best way to eat spaghetti. Do you?
