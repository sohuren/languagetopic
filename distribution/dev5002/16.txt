Johnny and his class were looking forward to a fun day in art class. The teacher gave the class paint, brushes and other items to use to make their drawings. Johnny's friend Kevin used a straw to blow paint on his paper. It looked very cool. Lisa used markers to make a picture of her and her dog. Lisa has several pets, but her favorite one is her dog, Ben. Tony used a potato to make stars. He then put the potato into different colors of paint and made a nice pattern. Johnny used feathers to make his picture. When they had finished, the class chose which picture was the best. Johnny got second place and was very excited. Then it was time for lunch and the class had a party. They had hamburgers with ketchup and had cake for dessert. It was a very fun day for the whole class. They all went home tired and happy. Johnny took a nap when he went home.
