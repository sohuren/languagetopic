Once upon a time, a lion, a tiger, a bear, and a duck finished school. So, they moved out of their parents' houses and set out to get jobs. The lion flew on a red airplane. The tiger rode an orange train. The bear rode a yellow bus. And the duck sailed on a blue boat. The train went to Ohio. The bus went to Iowa. The boat sailed to Hawaii. And the airplane flew to Utah. The lion wanted to be a fireman. The tiger wanted to be a nurse. The bear wanted to be a doctor. And the duck wanted to be President. But none of them could find the job they wanted. So, they all became artists instead. The lion bought a crayon to draw with. The tiger bought a pen. The bear bought a pencil. And the duck bought a paintbrush. The crayon was red. The pen was yellow. The pencil was green. And the paintbrush was blue.
