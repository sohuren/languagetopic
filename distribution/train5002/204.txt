Kate's parents planned a family trip to Europe! This would be Kate's first big vacation out of America. She loves to be on planes. The plane ride was fun and they landed in Paris, France. They went to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River. Kate even learned how to say hello in French! They ate delicious food. Then they took a train to London, England. They drank tea and toast and went to see art. Then they took another plane to Spain. They went to the beach and ate delicious Spanish food. Spanish food was her favorite so far. A new friend taught her "Hola," which is hello in Spanish. Finally, they went to Italy. They ate pasta and pizza and saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Her mom took a funny picture of her pretending to hold the tower. She learned to say hello in Italian, too. Kate had such a fun time on her vacation. She took a lot of pictures and then made a photo album to show to her friends at school. Kate wants to go back to Europe one day. She loves to travel and see new and different places.
