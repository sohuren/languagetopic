The stinker was that no one let the elf in. He had waited at the door for four whole hours, but was afraid to knock in case the noise would wake the humans. This elf was the tooth fairy's helper, but one day hoped to work in the North Pole. That would never happen if he couldn't even help the tooth fairy with teeth on his first day working for her. It was almost morning now. Soon the children would wake up and run out the front door with their books for school. Inside, the tooth fairy would be wondering what was keeping him. "It's too dangerous to stay at this door," the elf thought, "The children might see me." Just then he heard the alarm clocks go off inside. He dove into a nearby bush and hid, hoping that his green uniform would help him match the color of the bush's leaves.
