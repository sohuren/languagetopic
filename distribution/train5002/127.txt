Tommy was a cowboy. He and his horse, Candy, lived by the Gentle River. The Gentle River was as clear as a mirror. One day, Tommy was riding Candy along the shore when he saw a fire in the distance. "Wow," Tommy said. "I wonder why there's a fire." Tommy and Candy went to see. The fire was deep in the hills, and it took a long time to get there. By the time they arrived, it was almost supper time. The fire was a campfire. There was a little girl at the fire. She was drawing pictures with crayons. "Hello," Tommy said. "What are you doing in the hills?" "I'm Lucy," the girl said. "I'm camping, but my tent got blown away by the wind. So I'm sitting by the fire and drawing pictures." "What are you drawing?" "I'm finishing up this drawing of a dragon," she said. Then she pointed at two drawings on the ground next to her. They were held in place with pebbles. "This is an elf," she said. "And this is a pony." "They're very pretty," Tommy said. "I'm Tommy, and this is Candy." "Pleased to meet you," Lucy said. "Would you like to draw with me? We can do a drawing of Candy together." "That would be fun," Tommy said. And so they sat down and drew a picture of Candy together.
