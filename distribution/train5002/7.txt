One day my dad was walking home and he had a big ice-cream cone. He had chocolate and vanilla and strawberry ice-cream on top of each other. He was moving his head back and forward to some music that he was playing when a spider dropped on his ice-cream for a little bite. My dad saw right away that a spider was on it and he brushed the spider off. After the spider was put on the floor, a fly flew into his ice-cream, right where the spider had been! Oh how terrible! My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too! My dad dropped his cone, ran away, and bought a yoghurt instead. He thought about buying a dingdong, but since dinner time was so close and he had such a big lunch, he thought a yoghurt would be better. It's a much safer and better dessert. 165 words.
