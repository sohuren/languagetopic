Charles went on a bike ride last week when he was on vacation. His father took him Saturday morning. It had rained Thursday and Friday. They got in his father's truck and put their bikes in the back. Father and son went to a bike path in a town near them. Trees were on both sides of the path. It was nice and warm outside, but Charles like riding on the road between the trees. There was a lot of shade. Charles saw several friends and people from school when they were riding. He got to ride with Harry and Peter. They also rode with Peter's sisters, Anne, Kelley, and Beth. His friend Paul also went by. They only said, "Hi," to each other. Charles fell once. He fell after seeing a girl he liked. Her name was Claire. She came over to see if he was okay. He had a small cut on his arm. His father put a bandage on his arm and they rode back to the truck. Charles and his father stopped for ice cream. They both got sundaes and ate them when they got home. They were glad they went for a ride because it also rained on Sunday.
