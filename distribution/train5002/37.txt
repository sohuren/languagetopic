On Sunday, our family went for a picnic. Mom, dad, Alice, Sissy (our dog), and I got in the van and drove to the park. Alice and I played fetch with Sissy. Dad fired up the grill and made some hamburgers. Mom made some salad. Mom asked me to spread the picnic cloth. Sissy wanted to help me too. Once the burgers were ready, we sat down to eat. They were delicious, I ate two! Alice only ate one hamburger. I didn't like the salad because I don't like carrots. Mom says they're good for me. Sissy doesn't like carrots either. After lunch, I played with dad and Alice played with mom and Sissy. Dad and I were flying a kite. Alice and mom played with flowers. Then we packed up the van and went home. I fell asleep on the way home. Sunday was a lot of fun. I want to do it again!
