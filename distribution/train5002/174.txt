Billy was a monster. He was born in Monster Town, where he learned how to be a monster and how to do monster things. One day Billy was very hungry. There are no stores in Monster Town, so Billy had to find his own food. He saw some bugs but he did not want to eat those because bugs are gross and taste bad. Then he saw a bunny and thought it would be a good thing to eat. Bunnies are very delicious. Monsters eat all sorts of things that humans do not eat. Billy chased the bunny into a field. Soon he could not find it any more. Bill was sad. He was still hungry. But then he saw a house. He sneaked towards it and looked inside. No one was home. He crawled through an open window and saw a funny looking box. He opened it and saw many little pebbles inside of all different colors. He was about to eat them when a small human child appeared out of nowhere and took the box out of his hands. Silly Billy, Trix are for kids.
