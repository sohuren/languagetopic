William was sitting in his room working on his homework. It was something he did since he went to kindergarten. William could see outside from where he was sitting. He had a view of a beautiful sunset this time of year. It was late spring, and he sometimes found his mind wandering as he looked outside, and hated losing time like that. The sooner he finished his homework, the sooner he could go to his friend Jacob's house, where he was spending the night. William loved sleepovers with Jacob. They would do fun stuff like tell jokes, watch TV, play board games, and eat lots of junk food. Jacob also had a cool RC car that William liked to play with. But William's parents wouldn't allow him to go to Jacob's house until he finished his homework first.
