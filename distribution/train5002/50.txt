It was Saturday, and every Saturday all the children on the block would have a bicycle race. Juan rode his new red bicycle to the dead end street where the race was held. He knew he would win. His new bicycle would be faster than anyone's. Anita was there on her white bicycle. Todd was riding a blue bicycle, and Jasper soon arrived on a yellow bicycle. The race began, and Juan was in the lead. He heard Anita crying behind him. He turned to see her chain was broken, and she had fallen from her bike into the green grass. Juan stopped and turned around to help Anita. Jasper and Todd rode past them, and it was soon clear that Todd would win the race. Juan walked Anita home, and she thanked him for being a good friend.
