Once upon a time there were a zebra and a monkey in a zoo. The zebra and the monkey had many napkins. What did the zebra and the monkey do with all the napkins? They didn't know. They ate the napkins. The zebra felt good. The monkey got a stomach ache. Why did the monkey get a stomach ache? The napkins were make out of straw. Straw is good for zebras. Straw is not good for monkeys. The monkey did not like eating the napkins. The zoo worker came and gave the monkey a pill. The pill made the monkey feel better. Now the monkey does not eat napkins. The monkey eats bananas instead of napkins. Now the monkey is always happy and feels good. The zebra does not like to eat bananas. The zebra eats all the napkins and feels good. The zebra and the monkey are both very happy.
