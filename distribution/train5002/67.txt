It was one week before Halloween and Thomas still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating. Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. "Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.
