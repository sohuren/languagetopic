There was a very friendly cow named Mary who loved to walk around the town and eat lots of grass. Mary loved grass so much, but she hated when she got a mouthful of weeds or dirt. One day when Mary was looking for some tasty grass, she spotted a pretty purple flower. Without thinking she ate the flower and got very sick. Mary walked home feeling very bad, and when she passed some green, orange, and red flowers, she didn't dare to eat them. When Mary got home her mom asked her why she was so sick. Mary could tell her mom, dad, and brothers Donny and Sam would be mad at her if she said she ate a flower so she lied. She told them that a bee stung her and she wasn't feeling good today. Then she lay down in her bed and took a long nap to feel better.
