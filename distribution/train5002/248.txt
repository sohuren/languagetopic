On Sunday, Bob wrote a lot down on a piece of paper. Bob wrote a lot about his lip. Bob then walked around. Bob took a look at a pan in the kitchen. Bob then walked around in the vegetable garden. Matt was standing in the garden. Matt asked Bob if he wanted to play. Bob said no. Bob did not want to play with anyone. Matt walked away. Bob went inside. Bob walked into the living room and sat on the couch.
