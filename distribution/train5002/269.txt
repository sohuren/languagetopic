At the farm, the farmer found that he needed to go to the town to get some tools. He needed to pick up five things at the store. The farmer needed to get a shovel, some hay, extra string, feed for the horses and a tire for his truck. He also found that one of the steps on his ladder was broken and needed to be fixed. He would have to get some wood to fix the ladder. He thought he might like to look at new ladders and see if it was time to get a new one. He went into the house and found his keys. He started driving down the road when he found that he forgot his wallet and needed to go back to the house. He turned the truck around and went back to the house. While he was in the house, he remembered that he also needed to get some milk at the store. He picked up his keys and wallet and went back to his truck. He picked up all the items he needed in town and was still home in time for dinner.
