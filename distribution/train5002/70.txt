Anna loved the beach and went as often as she could. She liked the birds and the waves. Jason did not like the beach. He did not like how warm the sand was. He didn't like the salt in the water. Jason wanted to stay home. Jason went to the beach with his mother and father and met Anna. She had a red kite that Jason liked very much. Anna was having trouble getting the kite in the air and was sad. Jason went over to help her and together they got the kite into the air and watched it go higher and higher. Anna let Jason fly the kite for a little bit. After that Jason was hungry. Anna showed him that she had brought a green Picnic basket from her house. Inside the picnic basket there were cakes and sandwiches and salad and some fruit. Jason had brought lemonade in a blue bottle and shared it with Anna. It was the most fun Jason had at the beach.
