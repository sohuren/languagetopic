I love to bake cakes for my granddaughter Abigail. She gets so happy when she eats them! So one day, I thought I'd surprise her at school with cake for her school class! I thought that would make her love me even more. I went into the kitchen and washed my hands. Then I dried them on a dishtowel. I went to the refrigerator and took out my cake mix. Then I took out the special bottle of vanilla sauce! I always pour it in for Abigail. Her mom and dad like orange sauce, but Abigail loves vanilla sauce. I mixed it in with the cake mix, and put it on the table. Then I went to turn on the oven. Then, a bad thing happened! My friendly old cat Billy jumped up to smell the mix! Billy also loves vanilla sauce! But then Billy accidently kicked the mix! It fell all the way from the table to the ground. My lip tightened as I started to cry. Now, Abigail wouldn't have a cake for her class. What a silly Billy!
