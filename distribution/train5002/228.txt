All the Grizzly bears felt excitement at the arrival of their new shirts; everyone except Truman, he was a very unhappy bear who didn't like to wear clothing. He also hated tying his shoes and matching his socks. These were all things Truman didn't like doing. So when the Grizzly bear king held a town meeting to pass out all the shirts, Truman stole the microphone and sang a song to express his feelings: "I won't wear those shirts you bear bosses, I won't wear my socks. I have all the fur I need, don't put me in a shirt box. I want to scratch the ground with my claws, and feel the wild wind; If you all make me wear, then my darlings as a bear, I think I'll smash you with my paws, and chew off all your skins." The other bears felt Truman had a point, and so they too chewed up the shirts, shoes, and socks the king gave them; and they chose a king who didn't have a mustache and never, ever wore a shirt and tie.
