Adam and his mom, Deborah, ran across the front lawn of their house. The grass was very tall, the lawn had not been mowed. After removing the groceries from the car, Adam had wanted to play in the yard. Deborah did not. She was sad that her new boss at work, Pierre, did not seem to like her. She ran along with Adam, but he could tell that Deborah was upset. Adam asked his mom what was bothering her. Deborah explained that she felt like her new boss was not nice to her. Adam sat down in the grass and asked Deborah to sit down next to him. He told her that he had a bully in his class named Mike. Adam said that all he had to do was ignore the bully and he would feel better. Then Adam asked why his mom could not ignore her new boss. Deborah explained to Adam that her new boss could fire her. Deborah frowned, took off her pink shoes, and walked inside the house to make rice for dinner.
