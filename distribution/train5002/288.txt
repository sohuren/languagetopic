Annie was helping her little brother Max pick flowers from the garden. They wanted to put the flowers in a jar to put on the kitchen table. Mother's Day was the next day and their mother loved fresh flowers. After they picked flowers and put them in a jar, Max asked Annie if they could have a snack. Annie took Max into the kitchen and got out an apple to slice up. They sat down at the table looking at the flowers and ate their apple slices. There was a window in the kitchen that let in sunlight. "Hey!" Max said, pointing at one of the roses in the jar. "There's something moving on that rose." Annie looked more closely at the flowers. "It's a ladybug," she said. "We need to take it back outside." Suddenly the ladybug began flying around the kitchen. Max jumped up and ran around trying to catch it. At last he clapped his hands around it. "Careful!" said Annie. Max walked outside and let the ladybug go.
