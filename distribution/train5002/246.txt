One day a young princess named Amelia was looking out of the window of her castle. Amelia loved to sing, but was tired of singing only the songs her mother, Queen Anne, allowed her to sing. Princess Amelia thought it might be fun to write her own songs instead. So, on Saturday Princess Amelia went to the garden with a pen and paper. She thought and thought, but couldn't come up with any words for a song. What could she write about? Daisy, her cow? Her frog, Pete? Nothing came to mind. She sat there all day. And the next day too. Amelia was tired and hungry. But she wanted to stay until she had a song. Finally, on Monday, Queen Anne came looking for Amelia and forced her to return to her room. She gave Amelia a large book of songs to sing. Amelia was happy.
