Barry the bowl lived in a cabinet in the kitchen. He sat next to the pots and under the pans. He liked his home, but he never got out much. He was only used for mixing when his friend wanted to bake a cake. One day, his friend pulled him out of the cabinet and put him on the table. He got out the eggs, flour and sugar and began to bake a cake. Barry was very excited. He looked around the kitchen as his friend mixed up all the ingredients. He saw a sink, a refrigerator and a toaster. He was sad to go back in the cabinet when his friend was all done with the cake. But he wasn't going back yet! His friend set him in the sink to wash out all of the leftover ingredients. It was a fun day out of the cabinet. Now it was time for him to go back home and wait for another day and another adventure.
