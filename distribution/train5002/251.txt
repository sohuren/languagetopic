Janice spent the weekend at a family party in Moore, Georgia. While she was there, she played with her cousin Justine. The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together. Janice's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with Justine and her dog, Boots. Boots did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them. His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water. They also went on a fast boat around the lake. Justine's favorite thing to do was ride in a tube behind the boat. When they got out, they were soaking wet. They dried off with towels before going to Greg's Country Store for some lemon ice box cake. Boots got so muddy at the lake! When they got back to the cabin, they had to give him a bath. Because they were so active during the day, they fell asleep quickly and slept until the morning.
