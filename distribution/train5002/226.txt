Jason lay in his bed after a night of no sleep. He was too excited for today. There was a football game that he was going to play with his friends. It would be him, Jack, James, and John competing with David, Ruth, Parsons, and Mike. David, Rush, Parsons, and Mike were much bigger than them, and were big bullies at school. When Jason got up, he had the choice to eat cereal, candy, chocolate milk, or pizza. He chose to eat cereal because he thought that eating something good for you would make him play better. They were going to play at the school, but the school was closed. They then went to the park, and got their teams set up. Jason's team got the ball first and they scored! David's team got the ball next, but they also scored. Unfortunately, it started raining. Everyone was getting wet, and people were starting to get angry. A fight soon broke out, and they all started fighting with each other. Eventually, Jason yelled for everyone to stop. They all stopped and chose to eat pizza together and forgive each other. Jason then went home bruised and dirty, and his parents grounded him for getting into a fight.
