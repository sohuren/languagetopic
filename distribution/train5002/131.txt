When summertime came Jack the Pirate made up his mind it was time to get his hair cut. He told all his friends that it was because he wanted a new look. But the truth was the Sun was too hot for Jack the Pirate. His long hair only made it worse. So he left his home by Whipple Creek and went into town to visit the Edward the Barber at his barbershop. It was fun getting his hair cut, and when it was done Jack the Terrier felt fresh and cool. "Your friends won't even know it's you, Jack!" said Edward the Barber as Jack the Pirate headed out the door. On the way back home, he took a short cut through the forest, and he met three people who were his friends. First he met Ichabod the Chief of Police, who was doing an important case. Jack said "Hello, Ichabod!" but Ichabod ignored him. The second person he met was Willy the Candy Man, who was delivering delicious treats. Jack said "Howdy, Willy!" but Willy didn't say anything back. The third person Jack met was Dean the Librarian, who was looking for a book he had lost. Jack said "Hey, Dean!" but Dean didn't stop looking for his book. "That's odd," thought Jack to himself, as he arrived home. "Why did all of my friends ignore me today?" Then he looked in the mirror and saw why. He looked like a totally different person. His friends must not have even known it was him!
