Duck lived next door to Bear. Duck answered the door, but Fox wasn't there. Turtle went to Goose's house next. Goose answered the door, but Fox wasn't there. Finally, Turtle stopped at Rabbit's house. Rabbit wasn't home, and Fox wasn't there. Turtle was sad because he wanted to go fishing with his friend. He walked slowly toward the stream to go fishing by himself. When he got to the stream, he found Fox and Rabbit were there. They were fishing. They asked Turtle to join them. Turtle was very happy that he had found Fox, and he joined them for a fun afternoon of fishing in the stream.
