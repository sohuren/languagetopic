David and Sue went to their Auntie's house to visit on Saturday morning. She had some new ducklings in the pond that they wanted to see. They went out to the pond and on the way they saw a frog. They also saw a boat in the water. They saw a water lily. They looked in the water until they saw the mother duck and her ducklings. They were different colors. Six of them were brown and yellow. Four of them were only yellow. Two ducklings were brown. There was one that was white. They were all very fuzzy. They went back to the house to tell Auntie Beth about the ducklings. She was cooking on the stove. She asked Sue to get some eggs. She asked David to get some butter. Auntie Beth poured some milk into a bowl of flour. She made them a cake. "I'm so glad you've come to visit me," Auntie Beth said. Sue told her about the things they saw at the pond. David said, "We saw a frog. Don't forget the frog. It was my favorite." It was a good visit.
