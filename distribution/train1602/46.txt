Two kittens were playing. They had come in from outside. Now they were in the living room in the house. One kitten was named Snowball and one kitten was named Fuzzy. Suddenly, Snowball saw something interesting. "Look at that!" said Snowball. "What is it?" asked Fuzzy. "It's a ball of yarn. On the top shelf!" said Snowball. She had seen the yarn that was kept in a basket up there! "That looks like it's fun to play with!" said Fuzzy. "But how could we get to it? It's so high up," he wondered. "I have an idea," said Snowball. "Watch this!" Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch. "What are  you doing?" asked Fuzzy. "Just watch!" said Snowball. Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then, she jumped to the middle shelf. "That's dangerous!" said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens. They weren't used to jumping very high yet. "Don't worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here." said Snowball. Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. "Look out below!" she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor. "Whoa!" said Fuzzy. "Thanks!" Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor. There, she and her brother played with the ball of yarn until they got tired and took a nap.
