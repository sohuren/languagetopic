Rob is a dog. Rob is a big red dog. He likes to go to the park. Rob likes the swing. He likes to go as high as he can. To get to the park, Rob has to go to town. When he is in town, he walks by the school. It is by the baseball field. Rob likes to go to the park with Rod. Rod is a small dog. Rod is a brown dog. Rod likes to go down the slide. Rod likes to go fast. Rob likes to slide too. Rob and Rod like to go down the slide many times. When it gets dark, Rob and Rod have to go home. Rob has to go home. He has to go eat. Swinging makes Rob hungry. Rod has to go home too. He does not like to be in the dark. They can go to the park tomorrow. Goodbye Rob and Rod.
