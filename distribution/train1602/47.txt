Bobby's grandmother was studying at a school in New York City. She lived at the school year round. So Bobby's mother put him on a bus to the city and his grandmother picked him up at the Port Authority bus stop. They took the train back to the school. They put Bobby's backpack on a rack in the guest room. Then Bobby and his grandmother went out for a walk. They stopped at a corner shop for pizza and sodas. Then they walked to the Empire State Building. At the top of the Empire State Building they looked out over the city. They counted all the bridges and looked at all the tall buildings. Bobby bought three postcards and a little snow globe in the shop. Then they took the elevator back to the ground floor. Next they took a yellow cab to Central Park. They rode the carousel and went to the zoo. Bobby's favorite animals were the monkeys. He did not like the snakes at all. After they had ice cream cones, Bobby and his grandmother took the train back to her school. They had salads for supper. Then they read a story together. Bobby's grandmother made up her sofa bed for Bobby as they made plans for the next day. Bobby wanted to know if they could go to a baseball game. His grandmother said she would get tickets.
