Jake wanted to eat an orange. He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house were apples, which he didn't like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy. But his mother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator. Jake couldn't reach the top of the refrigerator. He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards. But the stool wasn't tall enough on its own. He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen sink he could reach the oranges. (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator). So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of the sink to get the oranges. He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on top of the refrigerator. Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange. He sat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it. Then he took all of the pieces of orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.
