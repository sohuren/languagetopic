One night I was at my friend's house where he threw a party. We were enjoying our dinner at night when all of a sudden we heard a knock on the door. I opened the door and saw this guy who had scar on his face. I asked my friend "who is that guy?" , and he told me that it was his friend. I didn't trust that guy because he looked very strange. After we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted to talk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I saw that the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him to leave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time he was dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside the house and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the cop car coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day.
