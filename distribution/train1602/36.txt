There was a big race in town. Stephanie and Sarah were friends. Stephanie was faster than Sarah. On the day of the race, they wished each other good luck. Sarah tripped on a rock during the race. She cried but another one of her friends, Matt, helped her stand up. Stephanie cheered for her to finish after she crossed the line. On the next day Sarah came into school with a bruise on her knee. Jane thought she looked silly. They were in the same class. Jane did not make fun of Sarah. She gave her a bandage instead. It had a cat on it to match Sarah's shirt. Sarah was still unhappy. She would not eat her lunch or play at recess. When Stephanie tried to talk to her she frowned. Then Stephanie gave Sarah a bunny toy that she liked. Sarah smiled. She gave Stephanie a hug.
