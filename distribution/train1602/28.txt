Johnny wakes up early this morning. He is so happy. Today Daddy is taking him to the aquarium. Johnny wants to see blue fish, red fish, yellow fish, and green fish. He also wants to see really big fish. Daddy and Johnny are at the aquarium. "Look!" Johnny says. "There's a big red fish!" The fish swims away. A small yellow fish swims up to the glass and looks at Johnny. "A yellow fish!" says Johnny, "He's tiny." Lots of blue fish swim by behind the yellow fish. "Look at all of those blue fish!" says Johnny. "They stay together." Daddy points at a long fish and says "That one is as big as me!" Johnny laughs. He still wants to find a green fish. He sees a lot of fish, but none of them are green. "Daddy, I can't find a green fish. I want to see a green fish." Daddy laughs. "Let's go to the next window and look." Johnny looks through the next window and sees lots of fish, but none of them are green fish. "I still don't see any green fish," says Johnny. "Look there," Daddy tells him. Johnny sees a green sea turtle! It's a lot bigger than a fish. After looking at all the fish, Daddy and Johnny go home again.
